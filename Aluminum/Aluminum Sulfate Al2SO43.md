# Aluminum Sulfate Al2SO43
#### 1. General Information:
* Aluminum Sulfate (Al2SO43) is a white, crystalline solid compound that is highly watersoluble. It is commonly known as alum or papermaker’s alum and has a chemical formula of Al2(SO4)3. It is an ionic compound composed of two aluminum atoms, three sulfur atoms, and twelve oxygen atoms.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Aluminum Sulfate has high solubility in water, with a solubility of 52.4 g/100 mL at 20°C. This solubility increases with temperature and decreases with decreasing pH. In soil and rock, the solubility of Aluminum Sulfate is relatively low due to the presence of other minerals and substances.
#### 3. Mobility:
* In soils, Aluminum Sulfate does not have high mobility due to its low solubility and strong binding to soil particles. However, it can leach out of the soil and move with water when it is applied in large amounts. In water bodies, alum particles can remain suspended for a long time, making it highly mobile.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* Aluminum Sulfate is stable at high temperatures and does not undergo any significant chemical changes. However, at higher temperatures, its solubility increases, and it may be more prone to leaching in soil and water.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Aluminum Sulfate is not significantly affected by changes in pressure. It remains a stable compound under normal atmospheric pressure conditions.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* The solubility of Aluminum Sulfate is highly dependent on pH. It has a strong acidic nature and is commonly used to lower the pH in water treatment processes. At lower pH levels, the solubility of Aluminum Sulfate increases, and it becomes more mobile in the environment.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Aluminum Sulfate has a melting point of 770°C and a boiling point of 330°C. It is highly hygroscopic, meaning it readily absorbs water from the environment. When dissolved in water, it forms a slightly acidic solution.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Aluminum Sulfate is considered to be nontoxic to humans and animals when ingested in small amounts. However, it can have adverse effects on aquatic organisms at high concentrations. Plant growth can also be affected when Aluminum Sulfate is present in high amounts in the soil.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Aluminum Sulfate is commonly used in water treatment processes, where it acts as a coagulant to remove impurities from water. It is also used in the papermaking industry to improve the strength and brightness of paper. In addition, it is used in the production of fireresistant materials, food additives, and as a pigment in paints and dyes.
