# Aluminum Nitrate AlNO33
#### 1. General Information:
* Aluminum Nitrate (Al(NO3)3) is an inorganic compound that consists of a white crystalline solid salt. It is highly soluble in water and hygroscopic, meaning it can absorb moisture from the environment. It has a chemical formula of Al(NO3)3 and a molar mass of 213.01 g/mol. Aluminum nitrate is commonly used in industrial and laboratory settings, as well as in some fertilizers.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Aluminum nitrate is highly soluble in water, with a solubility of 1150 g/L at 20°C. It is also soluble in both polar and nonpolar solvents, such as ethanol and acetone. The solubility of aluminum nitrate decreases as the temperature decreases, meaning it becomes less soluble in colder temperatures.
#### 3. Mobility:
* In terms of mobility, aluminum nitrate is considered mobile in both soil and water. In soil, it can move through the soil layers with the percolating water. In water, it can be transported by surface runoff or groundwater flow. The mobility of aluminum nitrate is influenced by soil properties, such as pH and organic matter content.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* As mentioned earlier, the solubility of aluminum nitrate is affected by temperature. At high temperatures, it is highly soluble and can easily dissolve in water. However, at low temperatures, its solubility decreases and it may precipitate out of solution. In terms of chemical reactions, aluminum nitrate can decompose at high temperatures to form nitrogen dioxide and aluminum oxide.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Pressure does not have a significant effect on the solubility or mobility of aluminum nitrate. However, as pressure increases in deep water bodies, it may result in the formation of more hydrates of aluminum nitrate, which could affect its solubility.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* The solubility of aluminum nitrate is highly influenced by pH. At neutral or acidic pH levels, it stays in its dissolved form. However, as the pH becomes alkaline, aluminum hydroxide compounds can form and precipitate out of solution. This can reduce the solubility of aluminum nitrate.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* In addition to its solubility and mobility, other physical properties of aluminum nitrate include its melting point of 73.6 °C, boiling point of 150 °C, and density of 1.72 g/cm3. It is also hygroscopic, meaning it can absorb moisture from the environment. Aluminum nitrate is not flammable but can react with reducing agents and may ignite.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* In small amounts, aluminum nitrate is not considered toxic to plants and animals. However, in high concentrations, it can have negative effects on plant growth and can be harmful to aquatic organisms. In the atmosphere, aluminum nitrate particles can contribute to acid rain, which can have detrimental effects on plants and animals.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Aluminum nitrate has various industrial applications, such as in the production of aluminum powder and aluminum alloys. It is also used as a catalyst in organic synthesis and as a mordant in textile dying. In agriculture, aluminum nitrate is used as a source of nitrogen and aluminum for fertilizers. It also has uses in the production of explosives and as a reagent in chemical reactions.
