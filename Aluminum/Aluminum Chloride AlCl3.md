# Aluminum Chloride AlCl3
#### 1. General Information:
*  Chemical Formula:
AlCl3
*  Molecular Weight:
133.34 g/mol
*  Appearance:
White or pale yellow solid
*  State at room temperature:
Solid
*  Melting Point:
190.7 °C
*  Boiling Point:
180.8 °C (sublimes)
*  Density:
2.48 g/cm3
*  Solubility in water:
Highly soluble, forms a clear, colorless solution
#### 2. Solubility:
* Aluminum chloride is highly soluble in water, meaning that it readily dissolves in water to form a clear, colorless solution. The solubility of solid aluminum chloride decreases with decreasing temperature, while the solubility of gaseous aluminum chloride increases with increasing temperature.
* In soil and rock, the solubility of aluminum chloride is affected by the pH of the environment. In acidic soils, aluminum chloride may dissolve more readily, while in alkaline soils, it may be less soluble.
#### 3. Mobility:
* In water, aluminum chloride is highly mobile due to its high solubility. It can easily move through soil, rock, and other porous materials and may contaminate groundwater if spilled or leaked.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* The dissolution of solid aluminum chloride in water is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. This can cause an increase in temperature of the surrounding environment. At high temperatures, the solubility of gaseous aluminum chloride increases, while the solubility of solid aluminum chloride decreases.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* The solubility of aluminum chloride is not significantly affected by pressure. However, when heated at high pressure, aluminum chloride can undergo a phase change from solid to gas, a process known as sublimation.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Aluminum chloride is acidic in nature and can lower the pH of aqueous solutions. In soil and water, it can react with alkaline substances to form aluminum hydroxides, thereby lowering the pH.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Aluminum chloride has a low vapor pressure, meaning it does not easily evaporate into the atmosphere. It is also highly hygroscopic, meaning it readily absorbs moisture from the air.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Aluminum chloride is toxic to aquatic organisms, and prolonged exposure to high levels can harm fish and other aquatic life. It may also have harmful effects on plant growth and development.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
#### Aluminum chloride has many industrial applications, including:
*  As a catalyst in chemical reactions, particularly in the production of dyes and pharmaceuticals
*  In wastewater treatment to remove phosphates and other contaminants
*  In the production of aluminum metal
*  As an ingredient in antiperspirants
*  In the production of rubber and plastics
*  In the dyeing of textiles
*  As a flame retardant in various materials
*  In the production of paper and pulp
* In conclusion, aluminum chloride is highly soluble and mobile in water, and its solubility and other physical properties are affected by temperature and pH. It is commonly used in various industrial applications, but it can also have negative impacts on the environment and living organisms.
