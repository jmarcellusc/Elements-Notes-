# Aluminum Hydroxide AlOH3
#### 1. General Information:
* Aluminum hydroxide (AlOH3) is a naturally occurring mineral that is also known as gibbsite. It is found in soil, rocks, and water systems. It is a white, odorless powder that is insoluble in water.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Aluminum hydroxide has very low solubility in water, with a solubility of only 1.18 mg/L at 25°C. This solubility decreases as the temperature decreases and pH increases. At high pH levels, the solubility of aluminum hydroxide is greatly reduced, making it less mobile in water.
#### 3. Mobility:
* In soil, aluminum hydroxide has low mobility due to its low solubility in water. It tends to remain in the soil and not move through the soil profile. However, in acidic soils, aluminum hydroxide can become more soluble and potentially leach downwards.
* In water systems, aluminum hydroxide can be transported through surface water or groundwater. Its transport is influenced by the pH of the water and the presence of other substances that can complex with the aluminum, making it more or less mobile.
* In rock formations, aluminum hydroxide may be present as a solid or suspended in water. Its mobility in these systems depends on factors such as the pressure and temperature conditions.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* The solubility of aluminum hydroxide decreases at lower temperatures. This means that at high temperatures, such as in hot springs or geothermal areas, aluminum hydroxide may be more soluble and therefore more mobile in water.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* The solubility and mobility of aluminum hydroxide are not significantly affected by pressure changes. However, at very high pressures, such as in deep underground formations, it may be present in a more solid form.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Aluminum hydroxide is highly pH sensitive. It is most soluble in acidic conditions and least soluble in alkaline conditions. Its solubility increases as the pH decreases, which can lead to increased mobility in acidic soils and waters. In alkaline conditions, aluminum hydroxide may precipitate out of solution, making it less mobile.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Aluminum hydroxide has a low specific gravity of 2.42 g/cm3, meaning it is relatively light compared to other minerals. It has a low bulk density of 1.2 g/cm3, making it easily transportable in air and water. It has a melting point of 300°C.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Aluminum hydroxide is not known to be toxic to humans or animals. However, it can have negative effects on plant growth when present in high concentrations in the soil. It can also contribute to the formation of kidney stones in humans.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Aluminum hydroxide has many industrial applications, including as a flame retardant in plastics, as a filler in paper and paints, and as an ingredient in antacids. It is also used in water treatment to remove impurities and as a flocculant in wastewater treatment. In the pharmaceutical industry, it is used in various medications, including as an antacid and an antidiarrheal agent.
