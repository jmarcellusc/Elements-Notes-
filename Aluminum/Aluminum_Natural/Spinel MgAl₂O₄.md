# Spinel MgAl₂O₄
* 1. General Information
* Spinel MgAl₂O₄ is a mineral composed of magnesium, aluminum, and oxygen. It has a cubic crystal structure and is typically a dark purple or black color. It is commonly found in volcanic rocks such as basalt and peridotite, as well as in metamorphic rocks such as marble and gneiss.
* 2. Solubility
* In terms of solubility, spinel MgAl₂O₄ is insoluble in water and most acids. It does, however, slowly dissolve in strong acids such as hydrochloric acid. In soil, spinel is relatively stable and does not readily leach out into water.
* 3. Mobility
* Spinel MgAl₂O₄ is not mobile under normal environmental conditions. Its low solubility and lack of reactivity prevent significant movement through rocks and soil. However, it may become slightly more mobile in acidic conditions or under extreme temperatures and pressures.
* 4. Temperature Effects
* Under high temperatures, spinel MgAl₂O₄ can undergo a process called inversion, in which the magnesium and aluminum ions switch places within the crystal structure. This can result in a color change from dark purple to red or pink. At very high temperatures, spinel may melt and become more mobile.
* 5. Pressure Effects
* Under high pressure, spinel MgAl₂O₄ may undergo a phase change to a denser form known as rhospinel. This can occur in areas where rocks are subjected to extreme pressures, such as in the lower mantle of the Earth. This phase change can also impact the color and other physical properties of the mineral.
* 6. pH Sensitivity
* Spinel MgAl₂O₄ is relatively inert and does not have a strong sensitivity to pH. It is stable in both acidic and basic environments and does not undergo any significant changes in its chemical composition or physical properties.
* 7. Other Physical Properties
* Spinel MgAl₂O₄ is a hard mineral, with a Mohs hardness of 8, making it resistant to scratching. It has a high melting point of around 2,755 degrees Celsius. It is also a good conductor of heat and electricity.
* 8. Biological Significance
* Spinel MgAl₂O₄ does not have a significant role in biological processes and is not known to have any biological significance.
* 9. Industrial Applications
* The most common industrial use of spinel MgAl₂O₄ is as a refractory material in hightemperature applications, such as furnace linings and coatings for metal alloys. It is also used as an additive in the production of ceramics, glass, and pigments. In recent years, synthetic spinel has also been used as a gemstone and is considered a durable and affordable alternative to natural gemstones such as sapphire and ruby.
