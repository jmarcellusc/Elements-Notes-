# Cryolite Na₃AlF₆
#### 1. General information:
* Cryolite (Na₃AlF₆) is a mineral compound composed of sodium, aluminum, and fluoride ions. It is found in nature as colorless to white crystals, but commercially available cryolite is usually pale yellow or brown due to impurities. It has a Mohs hardness scale of 2.53 and a density of 2.95 g/cm³.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Cryolite has low solubility in water, with a maximum solubility of 0.4 g/L at 20°C. It is more soluble in acidic solutions and forms complexes with aluminum ions, leading to higher solubility in acidic conditions. In alkaline conditions, the solubility of cryolite decreases due to the formation of less soluble aluminum hydroxide.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Cryolite is not very mobile in soils and sediments, as it tends to adsorb to clay particles and organic matter. However, it can be transported through water, especially in acidic conditions where it is more soluble.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* At high temperatures, cryolite can decompose to release toxic hydrogen fluoride gas and sodium fluoride. The exact decomposition temperature depends on factors such as pressure, particle size, and source of heat. Cryolite is stable at low temperatures and can be used as a fluxing agent in the production of aluminum and other metals.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Cryolite undergoes little change in properties under normal pressures. However, under high pressure, it can undergo phase transformations and show changes in its solubility and melting point.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* The solubility of cryolite is highly pHdependent, with higher solubility in acidic conditions and lower solubility in alkaline conditions. It also shows sensitivity to changes in pH in terms of its stability and ability to release fluoride ions.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
*  Melting point:
1,010°C
*  Boiling point:
1,917°C
*  Thermal conductivity:
0.349 W/m·K
*  Electrical conductivity:
3.5 x 10^16 Ω^1·m^1
*  Magnetic properties:
Nonmagnetic
*  Flammability:
Noncombustible
*  Odor:
Odorless
*  Toxicity:
Can release toxic gases such as hydrogen fluoride and sodium fluoride when heated or in acidic conditions.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Cryolite is not known to have any essential biological significance. In fact, it is considered toxic to plants and animals, especially in high concentrations. However, it is used in various industrial processes and may come into contact with living organisms, leading to potential environmental and health risks.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
#### Cryolite has various industrial applications, including:
*  As a solvent for bauxite in the production of aluminum
*  As a fluxing agent in the production of ceramics and glass
*  As a corrosion inhibitor in metal plating
*  As a pesticide in insect control
*  As a component in electrolytic baths for the production of metal alloys
*  In the manufacture of welding rods and fluxes
*  As a polishing agent for aluminum and stainless steel
*  In the manufacture of synthetic cryolite for use as a nontoxic insecticide and pesticide.
