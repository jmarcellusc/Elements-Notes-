# Diaspore AlOOH
#### 1. General Information:
* Diaspore is a mineral consisting of aluminum oxyhydroxide, with the chemical formula AlOOH. It is classified as a hydroxide mineral and is commonly found in bauxite deposits. It can be found in various forms, including granular, fibrous, and botryoidal (globular).
#### 2. Solubility:
* Diaspore is insoluble in water and has low solubility in most acids. It is slightly soluble in strong alkaline solutions. In soil, diaspore can undergo weathering and dissolve in the presence of acidic groundwater or soil solutions.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Diaspore has very low mobility in most environmental conditions. This is due to its low solubility in water and its resistance to leaching by most acids. However, under extreme conditions, such as acidic soils or acidic waters, diaspore can undergo weathering and become mobilized.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* Diaspore does not have any significant temperature effects. It is stable at high temperatures and does not undergo any phase changes or reactions.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Pressure has minimal effect on diaspore. It is stable in both high and lowpressure environments.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Diaspore is slightly soluble in strong alkaline solutions, making it more sensitive to high pH conditions. However, it is relatively stable in neutral and low pH conditions.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Diaspore has a Mohs hardness of 6.57, making it a relatively hard mineral. It has a white to gray color and a vitreous to pearly luster. It has a density of 3.33.5 g/cm3 and is not magnetic. Diaspore is not radioactive.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Diaspore does not have any known biological significance. However, it is often found in bauxite deposits, which are a major source of aluminum for industrial use.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Diaspore is primarily used as a source of aluminum in the production of aluminum metal. It can also be used as a refractory material and as a filler in plastics and rubbers.
