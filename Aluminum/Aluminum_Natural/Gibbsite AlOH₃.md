# Gibbsite AlOH₃
#### 1. General information:
*  Gibbsite (AlOH₃) is a mineral form of aluminum hydroxide and the most common mineral in the gibbsitekbotlandite mineral series.
*  It is a white, gray, or brownish mineral with a Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3.5.
*  Gibbsite is found in most bauxite deposits worldwide, as well as in gneisses, schists, and igneous rocks.
*  It is also a weathering product of various feldspars, micas, and other minerals containing aluminum.
*  Gibbsite has a trigonal crystal structure and is a nontoxic and nonradioactive mineral.
#### 2. Solubility:
*  Gibbsite has low solubility in water, with a solubility product (Ksp) of 3.24 x 10^33 mol^3/L^3 at 25°C.
*  It is slightly soluble in acidic solutions and more soluble in alkaline solutions due to the formation of soluble Al(OH)₄^ ions.
*  At pH levels less than 5, solubility increases as hydrogen ions dissociate the Al(OH)₃ lattice.
*  Gibbsite is insoluble in organic solvents.
#### 3. Mobility:
*  In soil, gibbsite is relatively immobile due to its low solubility and strong adsorption onto clay particles.
*  However, in high pH soils, gibbsite can be slightly mobile due to the presence of Al(OH)₄ ions.
*  When dissolved in water, gibbsite can be transported by surface runoff, groundwater, and erosion processes.
*  In the atmosphere, gibbsite can be transported through air particles and precipitation.
#### 4. Temperature effects:
*  The solubility of gibbsite decreases with increasing temperature due to endothermic dissolution reactions.
*  At low temperatures, kinetic barriers may inhibit the transformation of gibbsite to other forms of aluminum oxide minerals.
*  Hightemperature processes such as hydrothermal alteration and magma crystallization can lead to the formation of alternate aluminum minerals.
#### 5. Pressure effects:
*  Gibbsite is stable at low pressures and temperatures.
*  At high pressures, it can transform into other forms of aluminum minerals such as corundum or diaspore.
*  Pressure does not significantly affect the solubility of gibbsite.
#### 6. pH sensitivity:
*  Gibbsite has a pHdependent solubility, with higher solubility in alkaline conditions.
*  In acidic conditions, the Al(OH)₃ lattice can be disrupted, increasing solubility.
*  In highly alkaline environments, gibbsite can transform into other forms of aluminum hydroxide minerals.
#### 7. Other physical properties:
*  Gibbsite has a density of 2.42  2.43 g/cm³ and a specific gravity of 2.3  2.4.
*  It has a low electrical conductivity and is a good insulator.
*  When heated, gibbsite can lose its water molecules and become amorphous, and it can regain its crystalline structure upon cooling.
#### 8. Biological significance:
*  Gibbsite does not have any significant biologically relevant properties, and it is not considered toxic.
*  It is sometimes used in antacids as an ingredient to neutralize stomach acid.
#### 9. Industrial applications:
*  Gibbsite is the main source of aluminum for industrial use, as it is the primary component of bauxite ore.
*  It can also be used as a filler material in papermaking and as an ingredient in ceramics and coatings.
*  In the petroleum industry, gibbsite can be used as a catalyst for the production of liquid fuels.
*  In wastewater treatment, gibbsite can be used to remove phosphate and other pollutants from water.
