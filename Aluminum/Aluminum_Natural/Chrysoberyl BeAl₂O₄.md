# Chrysoberyl BeAl₂O₄
#### 1. General Information:
* Chrysoberyl (BeAl₂O₄) is a mineral with a chemical composition of beryllium aluminum oxide.
* It has a Mohs hardness of 8.5, making it one of the hardest gemstones.
* It has a hexagonal crystal structure and is typically green or yellow in color.
* It is commonly found in igneous and metamorphic rocks, as well as in alluvial deposits.
* Its name comes from the Greek words "chrysos" meaning gold and "beryllos" meaning light green.
* Other names for chrysoberyl include "cymophane" and "alexandrite" (a variety that exhibits color change depending on the light source).
#### 2. Solubility:
* Chrysoberyl is insoluble in water and most acids and bases.
* It can be dissolved in hydrofluoric acid (HF) and molten alkaline fluxes.
* It may also dissolve in the presence of fluorine gas at high temperatures.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Due to its insolubility, chrysoberyl does not exhibit any significant mobility in natural environments.
* However, it may become mobile through weathering processes that break down the surrounding rock and release the mineral into soil or water.
* Its mobility may also be enhanced through human activities such as mining.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* Chrysoberyl is stable at high temperatures, making it resistant to melting and sublimation.
* It has a melting point of approximately 2,000°C.
* Chrysoberyl may also exhibit a color change at high temperatures due to the crystal lattice rearranging.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* At high pressures, chrysoberyl may undergo phase transformations and could potentially transform into other minerals.
* It has been observed to transform into magnesium aluminum oxide spinel under highpressure conditions.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Chrysoberyl is not sensitive to pH, as it is insoluble in water and does not react significantly with acids or bases.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Chrysoberyl has a specific gravity of 3.53.9, meaning it is comparatively heavy for its size.
* It has a refractive index of 1.751.76 and exhibits a strong birefringence, meaning it can split light into two separate rays.
* It has a vitreous luster and may exhibit cats eye or starlike optical effects.
* It also has strong pleochroism, meaning it may appear different colors when viewed from different angles.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Chrysoberyl does not have any significant biological significance.
* It is not known to have any toxic or harmful effects on living organisms.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Chrysoberyl is primarily valued as a gemstone and is commonly used in jewelry.
* It is also used in industrial applications such as abrasives and heatresistant materials due to its hardness and high melting point.
* Due to its rarity, chrysoberyl can be highly prized and demand high prices in the gemstone market.
* There are limited industrial uses for chrysoberyl, but it has been explored as a potential source of beryllium metal, which is used in various industries including aerospace and nuclear energy.
