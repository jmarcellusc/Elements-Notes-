# Alunite KAl₃SO₄₂OH₆
#### 1. General Information:
*  Alunite (KAl₃SO₄₂OH₆) is a mineral composed of potassium, aluminum, sulfur and oxygen.
*  It is a member of the alunite group, which also includes the minerals natroalunite and jarosite.
*  Alunite typically forms as a secondary mineral in hydrothermal environments, where it can be found in veins or as a alteration product of other minerals.
*  It has a white, pale gray or light yellow color, and a vitreous to pearly luster.
*  Alunite has a Mohs hardness of 3.54, making it relatively soft and easy to scratch.
*  It has a specific gravity of 2.62.9, which is slightly lower than that of pure water.
*  The mineral was named after the Latin word for "alum," as it was used as a source of alum in the past.
#### 2. Solubility:
*  Alunite is sparingly soluble in water, with a solubility of approximately 0.25 g/L at 25°C.
*  However, its solubility can vary depending on the pH and presence of other ions.
*  In acidic conditions, the solubility of Alunite increases, while in alkaline conditions it can form insoluble precipitates.
#### 3. Mobility:
*  In terms of mobility, Alunite is considered to be relatively immobile.
*  Its low solubility and tendency to form solid precipitates make it less likely to move through the environment.
*  However, in highly acidic or alkaline environments, Alunite can dissolve or form soluble complexes, which may increase its mobility.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
*  Alunite is stable at temperatures below 500°C, but above this temperature it begins to decompose.
*  The decomposition of Alunite can occur through different pathways, depending on the temperature and pressure conditions.
*  At high temperatures, Alunite can release sulfur trioxide (SO₃) and water vapor, and the remaining solid can convert to other minerals such as pyrophyllite and orthoclase.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
*  Pressure can also affect the stability and decomposition of Alunite.
*  At lower pressures, Alunite may decompose to form kaolinite, a clay mineral.
*  However, at higher pressures, it may form an intermediate phase called dickite, before eventually converting to mullite and quartz.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
*  The solubility and stability of Alunite are highly dependent on the pH of the surrounding environment.
*  At a neutral pH, Alunite is relatively insoluble, but at acidic or alkaline pH values it can dissolve or form soluble complexes.
*  This pH sensitivity can also affect the mobility and transformation of Alunite in the environment.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
*  Alunite is not magnetic, and it does not conduct electricity.
*  It has a white streak and a brittle, conchoidal fracture.
*  The mineral may also exhibit fluorescence under UV light.
*  Alunite is commonly found as botryoidal or nodular masses, but it can also occur as crystals in the form of rhombohedrons or pseudooctahedrons.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
*  Alunite does not have any known biological significance.
*  While it may be present in small amounts in soil, rocks, and water, it is not considered to be a necessary mineral for plant or animal life.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
*  Alunite has been historically used as a source of alum, a compound used in the production of dyes, paper, and medicines.
*  It can also be used to produce alumina and potassium sulfate, both of which have various industrial applications.
*  Alunite may also have potential applications in the removal of heavy metals from contaminated water, due to its ability to form insoluble precipitates with these metals.
