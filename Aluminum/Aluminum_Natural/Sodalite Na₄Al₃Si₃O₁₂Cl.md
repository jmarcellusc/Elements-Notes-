# Sodalite Na₄Al₃Si₃O₁₂Cl
#### 1. General Information:
*  Sodalite is a mineral with the chemical formula Na₄Al₃Si₃O₁₂Cl.
*  It belongs to the group of feldspathoid minerals and is typically found in igneous rocks.
*  It has a vitreous to greasy luster and can range in color from blue to violet to white.
*  It has a Mohs hardness of 5.56 and a specific gravity of 2.272.35.
*  Sodalite has a trigonal crystal system and typically forms in dodecahedral or cubic crystals.
*  It was first described in 1811 and its name comes from its high sodium content.
#### 2. Solubility:
*  Sodalite is relatively insoluble in most common solvents.
*  It is only slightly soluble in water, with a solubility of 0.05 g/L at 25°C.
*  However, it can be partially dissolved by strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid.
*  Sodalite is also soluble in hot concentrated solutions of sodium and potassium hydroxide.
#### 3. Mobility:
*  Sodalite is not a mobile mineral and is typically found in situ, embedded in other minerals.
*  It can be moved through erosion and weathering processes, such as wind or water, but this is primarily in the form of tiny particles and not in its solid form.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
*  Sodalite is stable at high temperatures and can form in a wide range of temperatures, from 600°C to 1700°C.
*  However, as temperature increases, its color can change from blue to white.
*  Sodalite does not undergo phase transitions under normal atmospheric temperatures.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
*  The stability of sodalite is not significantly affected by pressure.
*  It can be found in a range of pressures, from low pressure environments on the Earths surface to high pressure environments deep within the Earths crust.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
*  Sodalite is not sensitive to changes in pH and is stable in a wide range of acid and alkaline environments.
*  It is commonly found in alkaline igneous rocks, with a pH of around 1112.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
*  Sodalite has a cubic cleavage and a conchoidal fracture.
*  Its streak is white and it has a dull to vitreous luster.
*  It is transparent to opaque and has a vitreous to greasy appearance.
*  It is not fluorescent under ultraviolet light.
*  Sodalite is optically isotropic, meaning it has the same physical properties in all directions.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
*  Sodalite does not have any significant biological significance.
*  It is not known to be toxic or carcinogenic to humans or animals.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
*  Due to its vibrant blue color, sodalite is sometimes used as a gemstone or decorative stone.
*  It is also used as a source of sodium in some industrial processes.
*  Sodalite is sometimes added to ceramics and glass to create a blue color.
*  It is also used as a decorative stone in various types of construction, such as countertops, flooring, and walls.
