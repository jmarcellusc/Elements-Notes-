# Kyanite Al₂SiO₅
#### 1. General Information:
* Kyanite (Al₂SiO₅) is a mineral composed of aluminum silicate with a chemical formula of Al₂SiO₅. It belongs to the family of silicate minerals and has a hardness of 4.55 on the Mohs scale. It is typically found in metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, schist, and eclogite, and is also commonly found in highpressure and lowtemperature environments.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Kyanite is insoluble in water and does not dissolve in acidic or basic solutions. It also has a low solubility in most other common solvents. Its low solubility makes it a stable mineral in most environments and allows it to withstand chemical weathering.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Kyanite is relatively immobile in soil, rock, and water environments. However, it can be transported by wind or water erosion and deposited in sedimentary environments. It is also commonly found in mineral veins and can be mobilized by hydrothermal fluids in specific geological settings.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* Kyanite forms at high temperatures (>700°C) and low pressures, typically in metamorphic environments. At temperatures above 1100°C, kyanite transforms into the mineral mullite. As temperature decreases, kyanite can transform into other minerals such as andalusite or sillimanite, depending on the temperature and pressure conditions.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Kyanite is a common indicator mineral for highpressure and lowtemperature metamorphic conditions. At low pressures, kyanite transforms into the mineral andalusite, and at high pressures, it transforms into the mineral sillimanite. These transformations are known as polymorphic phase changes and occur due to changes in pressure and temperature.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Kyanite is not sensitive to changes in pH and can withstand a wide range of acidic and basic conditions. Its stability in different pH conditions makes it a useful mineral for industrial and technological applications.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Kyanite has a specific gravity of 3.53 and a white streak. It is a triclinic mineral with two distinct crystal cleavage planes, giving it a characteristic bladed or tabular crystal habit. It also exhibits a strong birefringence, making it useful for optical and gemological purposes.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Kyanite does not have any known biological significance. It is not toxic to humans or animals and is considered a nonhazardous mineral.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Kyanite has several industrial applications due to its unique properties. It is commonly used in the production of heatresistant ceramics, such as furnace linings and kiln furniture. It is also used to manufacture refractory materials, including bricks, crucibles, and mortars. Its strong birefringence and attractive color also make it a popular gemstone, used in jewelry and decorative objects.
