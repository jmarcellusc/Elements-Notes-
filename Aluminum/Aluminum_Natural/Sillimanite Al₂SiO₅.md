# Sillimanite Al₂SiO₅
#### 1. General Information:
* Sillimanite (Al₂SiO₅) is a mineral that belongs to the silicate group and has a chemical composition of aluminum silicate (Al₂SiO₅). It is typically found as prismatic crystals, but can also occur in a massive form. It has a Mohs hardness of 6.57.5 and a specific gravity of 3.23.3. Sillimanite is commonly found in metamorphic rocks, particularly schists and gneisses, and is formed through the metamorphism of aluminous sediments.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Sillimanite is insoluble in water, as it is a mineral with a crystalline structure. However, it can undergo weathering processes that can release aluminum and silica ions into soil and water.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Sillimanite does not move or migrate in soil or water, as it is a mineral with a fixed crystalline structure. However, as mentioned before, weathering processes can release aluminum and silica ions from sillimanite, which can then be transported by water.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* Sillimanite is stable at high temperatures, as it is formed through metamorphism. It can withstand temperatures up to 1100°C without any significant changes. At lower temperatures, sillimanite can undergo transformation into other minerals such as mullite and kyanite.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Sillimanite is a highpressure mineral and can withstand pressures up to 3 GPa (gigapascals). It is typically formed under conditions of high pressure and temperature during metamorphism.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Sillimanite is not pH sensitive, as it is a mineral with a fixed structure. However, its weathering products, such as aluminum and silica ions, can have an impact on the pH of soil and water.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Sillimanite has a white to gray color and can have a pearly or vitreous luster. It has distinct cleavage and a monoclinic crystal structure. Sillimanite is anisotropic, meaning it has different physical properties in different crystal directions. It is a poor conductor of heat and electricity.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Sillimanite is not known to have any biological significance, as it is an inorganic mineral.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Sillimanite has high heat resistance and is used in the production of ceramics and refractories. It is also a source of aluminum and silica, which are used in the production of glass. Sillimanite is also used as a gemstone, commonly known as "Feldspar cats eye."
