# Andalusite Al₂SiO₅
#### 1. General Information:
* Andalusite is a mineral composed of the chemical compound Al₂SiO₅. It is a member of the sillimanite group and has a trigonal crystal structure, usually appearing as long, prismatic crystals or fibrous masses. Andalusite is commonly found in metamorphic rocks such as schist and gneiss, as well as in hydrothermal veins and contact metamorphic zones.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Andalusite is insoluble in most mineral acids, including hydrochloric, sulfuric, and nitric acid. However, it can be soluble in concentrated phosphoric acid and molten sodium hydroxide.
* In terms of solubility in different environments, Andalusite is generally considered insoluble in natural waters and soils due to its low water solubility and stability at normal atmospheric conditions. However, in acidic or alkaline conditions, Andalusite can slowly dissolve or weather, releasing aluminum and silica ions.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Andalusite is not mobile in soils and rocks, as it is a stable mineral at normal environmental conditions. Due to its low solubility, it is not expected to travel long distances in water or air.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* At high temperatures, Andalusite can undergo a reversible phase transformation to its hightemperature polymorph, kyanite. This transformation occurs at temperatures above 800°C and pressure above 1.5 kbar. At temperatures below 800°C, andalusite is the stable polymorph.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Andalusite is a stable mineral at atmospheric pressure, but at higher pressures, it can transform into its highpressure polymorph, sillimanite. This transformation occurs at pressures between 1.5 kbar and 3.0 kbar, depending on the temperature.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Andalusite is relatively chemically inert and is not significantly affected by changes in pH. It is insoluble in acidic and alkaline conditions and is stable over a wide pH range.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Andalusite is a hard, durable mineral with a Mohs hardness of 7 to 7.5. It has a specific gravity of 3.13.2 and a white to grey color, often with distinctive crosshatched twinning. It has a high melting point of 1,826°C and is a good insulator of heat and electricity.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Andalusite does not have any known biological significance. It is not known to be toxic to plants or animals and is not utilized by any living organisms.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Andalusite is primarily used as a refractory material in hightemperature applications, such as in the steel and glass industries. It is also used as a gemstone, with a variety of colors and properties depending on impurities and the angle of light. Andalusite is also used as a source of aluminum and silica in the production of ceramics and glass.
