# Corundum Al₂O₃
#### 1. General Information:
* Corundum Al₂O₃ is a naturally occurring mineral that is commonly known for its industrial applications, such as being the primary component in the production of aluminium metal. It is also used in the production of abrasives and refractory materials. Corundum has a hexagonal crystal structure and is the second hardest mineral after diamond. It can be found in many types of rock and soil, including granite, basalt, and shale.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Corundum Al₂O₃ is insoluble in water and acidic solutions. It is also resistant to dissolution by most acids and alkalis due to its high chemical stability. However, it can be slowly dissolved by hydrofluoric acid.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Due to its insolubility in water and resistance to dissolution, corundum Al₂O₃ has low mobility in most environments. It is not easily transported by water, wind, or other natural processes.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* Corundum Al₂O₃ is stable at high temperatures and can withstand extreme heat without melting. This makes it a valuable material for hightemperature applications, such as furnace linings and refractory bricks.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Corundum does not exhibit any significant changes in its physical or chemical properties under high pressure. This makes it suitable for use in highpressure environments, such as deepsea drilling and manufacturing processes.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Corundum Al₂O₃ is highly resistant to changes in pH and is not affected by acidic or alkaline environments. This is due to its high chemical stability and low solubility.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Corundum Al₂O₃ has a high melting point of 2072°C and a density of 3.98 g/cm³. It is also electrically insulating and has a high thermal conductivity. Additionally, it is transparent in its pure form and can range in color from colorless to various shades of blue, red, and green, depending on impurities present.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Corundum Al₂O₃ is not considered toxic to humans or the environment, and it is not known to have any significant biological significance. However, small amounts of corundum dust can be harmful if inhaled.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Corundum Al₂O₃ has various industrial applications due to its high hardness, chemical resistance, and thermal stability. These include its use as an abrasive material in sandpaper and grinding wheels, in the production of refractory ceramics, and as a mineral pigment in the manufacture of colored glass and ceramic glazes. Additionally, corundum is an essential component in the production of aluminium metal, as it is the primary source of aluminium oxide.
