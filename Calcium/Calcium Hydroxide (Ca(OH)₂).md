## Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂)

Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂), also known as slaked lime or hydrated lime, is a significant chemical compound widely used in construction, water treatment, soil stabilization, and other industrial processes. Calcium hydroxide has many names including **hydrated lime**, **caustic lime**, **builders' lime**, **slaked lime**, **cal**, and **pickling lime**. Below is a comprehensive summary of its properties:

### General Properties

* Chemical Formula: Ca(OH)₂
* Molar Mass: 74.09 g/mol
* Appearance: White powder or colorless crystalline solid
* Odor: Odorless
* Density: 2.21 g/cm³ at 20°C
* Melting Point: Decomposes at 580°C into calcium oxide (CaO) and water (H₂O)
* Boiling Point: N/A (decomposes before boiling)
* pH: Strongly alkaline, pH 12.4 in saturated solution

### Solubility

* **In Water:**
    * Calcium hydroxide is sparingly soluble in water, and its solubility decreases with increasing temperature:
        * 1.73 g/L at 20°C
        * 1.65 g/L at 25°C
        * 1.29 g/L at 100°C
    * The solution of calcium hydroxide in water is called limewater, which is a slightly alkaline solution.
    * As a result of its limited solubility, limewater is often used as a mild base for neutralization reactions or as a reagent in laboratory tests for CO₂ (e.g., in the limewater test for carbon dioxide).
* **In Acids:**
    * Calcium hydroxide reacts readily with acids to form calcium salts and water:

    ```
    Ca(OH)₂ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + 2H₂O
    ```

    * This makes it useful for neutralizing acidic conditions in both industrial and environmental settings (e.g., soil, wastewater).
* **In Organic Solvents:**
    * Calcium hydroxide is insoluble in organic solvents like alcohol, ether, and acetone.

### Mobility

* **In Water:**
    * Due to its low solubility, calcium hydroxide forms a saturated solution (limewater) when dissolved in water, but much of it remains as a solid precipitate. Once dissolved, the calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻) make it strongly alkaline.
    * Calcium ions are moderately mobile in aqueous environments, especially when compared to other cations. However, Ca²⁺ tends to precipitate out of solution in the presence of carbonate (CO₃²⁻) ions or when the solution is neutralized, forming calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), which has very low solubility.
* **In Soil:**
    * When applied to soils, calcium hydroxide improves soil structure by flocculating clay particles and increasing soil pH. The Ca²⁺ ions can exchange with other cations (such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium) in the soil, which enhances nutrient availability.
    * In highly alkaline or calcareous soils, the mobility of calcium hydroxide is low due to its precipitation as calcium carbonate.
* **In Air:**
    * Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the air to form calcium carbonate (CaCO₃):

    ```
    Ca(OH)₂ + CO₂ → CaCO₃ + H₂O
    ```

    * This reaction is important in the setting of lime in construction and the carbonation of limewater in the environment.

### Behavior Under Temperature and Pressure

* **At High Temperatures:**
    * Calcium hydroxide decomposes at elevated temperatures:
        * 580°C: Calcium hydroxide decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) and water:

        ```
        Ca(OH)₂ → CaO + H₂O
        ```

    * Beyond this temperature, calcium hydroxide cannot exist as a stable compound.
* **At Low Temperatures:**
    * The solubility of calcium hydroxide increases slightly at lower temperatures, making it more effective in cold water for applications like liming ponds or lakes for water treatment.
    * At lower temperatures, calcium hydroxide remains stable and retains its strong alkalinity.
* **Pressure Effects:**
    * Under normal atmospheric pressure, calcium hydroxide is stable. However, under high pressure, especially in industrial reactors, it can be converted back into calcium oxide and water more efficiently if the temperature also rises above its decomposition point (580°C).
    * High pressure can enhance the interaction of calcium hydroxide with other reagents, especially in water treatment processes.

### Chemical Properties

* **Strong Base:**
    * Calcium hydroxide is a strong base and dissociates in water to form calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻). It has a pH of 12.4, making it strongly alkaline.
* **Reactivity with Acids:**
    * As a strong base, calcium hydroxide reacts readily with acids to form calcium salts. For example, with sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), it forms calcium sulfate (CaSO₄), which is insoluble:

    ```
    Ca(OH)₂ + H₂SO₄ → CaSO₄ + 2H₂O
    ```

* **Reactivity with CO₂:**
    * When exposed to carbon dioxide (CO₂), calcium hydroxide reacts to form calcium carbonate (CaCO₃):

    ```
    Ca(OH)₂ + CO₂ → CaCO₃ + H₂O
    ```

    * This property is utilized in mortar setting and flue gas desulfurization.

### Industrial and Environmental Applications

* **Construction:**
    * **Mortar and Plaster:** Calcium hydroxide is an important component in lime mortars and plasters, where it sets through the reaction with carbon dioxide in the air (carbonation).
* **Water Treatment:**
    * **pH Regulation:** Calcium hydroxide is used to raise the pH of acidic waters, neutralize wastewater, and precipitate heavy metals.
    * **Flocculation:** In water treatment, calcium hydroxide aids in flocculating suspended particles, which improves water clarity.
* **Soil Stabilization and Agriculture:**
    * **Soil pH Correction:** Applied as agricultural lime, calcium hydroxide reduces soil acidity and provides calcium for plant nutrition.
    * **Soil Structure:** It improves the soil structure by causing clay particles to flocculate, thus enhancing soil aeration and water infiltration.
* **Environmental Remediation:**
    * **Acidic Mine Drainage:** Used in treating acidic mine waters by neutralizing the acidity and precipitating metals as hydroxides.

### Safety Considerations

* **Caustic Nature:** Calcium hydroxide is highly caustic, and direct contact with skin or eyes can cause burns. It should be handled with appropriate safety equipment (gloves, goggles).
* **Inhalation Hazard:** The dust can cause respiratory irritation if inhaled, so proper respiratory protection is recommended when handling the powder form.
* **Storage:** It should be stored in a dry environment to prevent reaction with moisture and carbon dioxide.
