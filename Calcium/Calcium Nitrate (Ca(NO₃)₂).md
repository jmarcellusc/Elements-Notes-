# Calcium Nitrate (Ca(NO₃)₂)
#### 1. General Information:
*  Calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2) is a colorless, watersoluble salt composed of calcium ions (Ca2+) and nitrate ions (NO3).
*  It has a molecular weight of 164 g/mol and a density of 2.5 g/cm3.
*  It can occur naturally in the form of mineral nitrocalcite, but is primarily produced synthetically by reacting calcium carbonate with nitric acid.
*  Calcium nitrate is widely used as a fertilizer, as well as in the production of concrete, explosives, and cooling baths for nuclear reactors.
#### 2. Solubility:
*  Calcium nitrate is highly soluble in water, with a solubility of 1210 g/L at 20°C.
*  It is also soluble in ethanol and methanol, but is insoluble in organic solvents such as benzene or hexane.
*  As a highly soluble salt, calcium nitrate can easily dissolve in water to form aqueous solutions that contain calcium and nitrate ions.
#### 3. Mobility:
*  In the soil, calcium nitrate is highly mobile and can easily travel with water through the soil layers.
*  However, its mobility can be limited in soils with high clay content or in soils with low levels of organic matter.
*  In the atmosphere, calcium nitrate can be present in the form of fine particles or aerosols, which can easily travel long distances before settling on the ground or in bodies of water.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
*  At high temperatures, calcium nitrate can decompose to form calcium oxide (CaO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and oxygen (O2).
*  This decomposition reaction can occur at temperatures above 500°C.
*  In contrast, calcium nitrate can also be used as a coolant in cooling baths for nuclear reactors due to its low freezing point.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
*  In general, calcium nitrate does not exhibit any significant changes in solubility or properties at different pressure regimes.
*  However, in concentrated solutions, high pressure can increase the rate of decomposition of calcium nitrate.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
*  Calcium nitrate is neutral in pH and does not affect the acidity or alkalinity of a solution.
*  However, it can contribute calcium ions to the solution, which can affect the pH if other compounds are present.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
*  Calcium nitrate is a stable compound with a melting point of 561°C.
*  It is hygroscopic, meaning it can absorb moisture from the air.
*  In its solid form, calcium nitrate can exist as different hydrates, such as the tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O).
*  Calcium nitrate also has a relatively high electrical conductivity.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
*  Calcium is an essential nutrient for plants and is an important component of cell walls.
*  When applied as a fertilizer, calcium nitrate provides plants with a source of both calcium and nitrogen.
*  However, excessive use of calcium nitrate can lead to an increase in soil salinity, which can negatively affect plant growth.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
*  Calcium nitrate is commonly used as a fertilizer for plants that require high levels of calcium, such as tomatoes and potatoes.
*  It is also used in the production of concrete to accelerate the curing process.
*  In the explosives industry, calcium nitrate is often used as an oxidizing agent.
*  In addition, it is used in a variety of other industrial applications, including wastewater treatment, leather tanning, and dye production.
