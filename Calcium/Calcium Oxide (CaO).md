## Calcium Oxide (CaO)

Calcium Oxide (CaO), commonly known as quicklime, is a versatile chemical compound widely used in industries like construction, steelmaking, and environmental treatment. Below is a detailed summary of its properties:

### General Properties

* Chemical Formula: CaO
* Molar Mass: 56.08 g/mol
* Appearance: White to pale yellow crystalline solid
* Odor: Odorless
* Density: 3.34 g/cm³ at 20°C (solid form)
* Melting Point: 2,572°C (4,662°F)
* Boiling Point: 2,850°C (5,162°F)
* pH: Basic, pH 12.4 in water (due to reaction with water to form calcium hydroxide).

### Solubility

* **Water Solubility:**
    * Calcium oxide is sparingly soluble in water, but it reacts exothermically with water to form calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂), commonly known as slaked lime.

    ```
    CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ (heat released)
    ```

    * Solubility in water: 1.79 g/L at 25°C. At this concentration, it does not remain as pure calcium oxide in solution but rather transforms into calcium hydroxide, which is more soluble.
    * The solubility of calcium oxide decreases with increasing temperature.

* **Solubility in Acids:**
    * Calcium oxide dissolves in most acids to form the corresponding calcium salts. For example, in hydrochloric acid (HCl), it forms calcium chloride (CaCl₂):

    ```
    CaO + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + H₂O
    ```

    * It is highly reactive with dilute acids, undergoing neutralization reactions.

* **Solubility in Organic Solvents:**
    * Calcium oxide is insoluble in organic solvents like alcohol, ether, and acetone.

### Mobility

* **In Water:**
    * Calcium oxide is not highly mobile in its solid form but reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide, which is more mobile and can leach through soil and water systems. The mobility of CaO in aquatic systems is often assessed via the mobility of the calcium ions (Ca²⁺) from the calcium hydroxide it forms.

* **In Air:**
    * Calcium oxide readily reacts with moisture and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to form calcium carbonate (CaCO₃). This reaction reduces the mobility of the compound in open environments over time:

    ```
    CaO + CO₂ → CaCO₃
    ```

    * The dust of calcium oxide is highly mobile as a particulate matter if not handled properly and can be airborne, causing irritation if inhaled.

* **In Soil:**
    * Once calcium oxide reacts with soil moisture, it forms calcium hydroxide, which increases soil pH. Over time, calcium hydroxide can react with CO₂ in the soil to form calcium carbonate, which is less mobile and precipitates out.

### Behavior Under Temperature and Pressure

* **At High Temperatures:**
    * Calcium oxide is thermally stable and can withstand very high temperatures without decomposing.
    * Melting Point: 2,572°C (4,662°F)
    * Boiling Point: 2,850°C (5,162°F). It becomes a gas at extremely high temperatures but only under industrial conditions such as those in furnaces.
    * Thermal Expansion: CaO expands when heated. Its linear thermal expansion coefficient is around 12.5 x 10⁻⁶ /°C.

* **Reaction with Water (Slaking):**
    * When water is added to calcium oxide, it undergoes an exothermic reaction (called slaking) to form calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂):

    ```
    CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ (heat released)
    ```

    * The heat generated is sufficient to boil water in some cases. This process is used in various industrial applications to produce slaked lime.

* **At Low Temperatures:**
    * Calcium oxide is relatively unreactive in dry, low-temperature environments. However, as the temperature increases, its reactivity with water and other chemicals also increases.

* **Under High Pressure:**
    * Calcium oxide remains stable under high pressures, though its physical properties, such as its bulk modulus and lattice parameters, may change slightly. Under extreme pressures, such as in geologic conditions, calcium oxide can undergo phase changes, but this is not common under typical industrial or environmental conditions.

### Chemical Properties
* **Strong Base:**
    * Calcium hydroxide is a strong base and dissociates in water to form calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻). It has a pH of 12.4, making it strongly alkaline.
* **Reactivity with Acids:**
    * As a strong base, calcium hydroxide reacts readily with acids to form calcium salts. For example, with sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), it forms calcium sulfate (CaSO₄), which is insoluble:

    ```
    Ca(OH)₂ + H₂SO₄ → CaSO₄ + 2H₂O
    ```

* **Reactivity with CO₂:**
    * When exposed to carbon dioxide (CO₂), calcium hydroxide reacts to form calcium carbonate (CaCO₃):

    ```
    Ca(OH)₂ + CO₂ → CaCO₃ + H₂O
    ```

    * This property is utilized in mortar setting and flue gas desulfurization.

### Industrial and Environmental Applications

* **Construction:**
    * **Mortar and Plaster:** Calcium hydroxide is an important component in lime mortars and plasters, where it sets through the reaction with carbon dioxide in the air (carbonation).
* **Water Treatment:**
    * **pH Regulation:** Calcium hydroxide is used to raise the pH of acidic waters, neutralize wastewater, and precipitate heavy metals.
    * **Flocculation:** In water treatment, calcium hydroxide aids in flocculating suspended particles, which improves water clarity.
* **Soil Stabilization and Agriculture:**
    * **Soil pH Correction:** Applied as agricultural lime, calcium hydroxide reduces soil acidity and provides calcium for plant nutrition.
    * **Soil Structure:** It improves the soil structure by causing clay particles to flocculate, thus enhancing soil aeration and water infiltration.
* **Environmental Remediation:**
    * **Acidic Mine Drainage:** Used in treating acidic mine waters by neutralizing the acidity and precipitating metals as hydroxides.

### Safety Considerations

* **Caustic Nature:** Calcium hydroxide is highly caustic, and direct contact with skin or eyes can cause burns. It should be handled with appropriate safety equipment (gloves, goggles).
* **Inhalation Hazard:** The dust can cause respiratory irritation if inhaled, so proper respiratory protection is recommended when handling the powder form.
* **Storage:** It should be stored in a dry environment to prevent reaction with moisture and carbon dioxide.
