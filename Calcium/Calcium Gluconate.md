# Calcium Gluconate
#### 1. General Information:
* Calcium Gluconate (C12H22CaO14) is a mineral salt made from combining calcium and gluconic acid. It is a white, odorless, crystalline powder and is commonly used as a calcium supplement in various forms such as tablets, capsules, and liquids. It is also used in the food and pharmaceutical industries as a food additive and in medical treatments for calcium deficiency and as an antidote for fluoride poisoning.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Calcium Gluconate is highly soluble in water, with a solubility of approximately 22.7 g/100 mL at 20°C. It is also slightly soluble in alcohol and insoluble in organic solvents such as ether and chloroform. In acidic conditions, the solubility of calcium gluconate decreases, while it increases in alkaline conditions.
#### 3. Mobility:
* In terms of mobility, calcium gluconate can easily move through soil and water due to its high solubility. It is not known to undergo any significant transformations in the environment and does not bind strongly to soil particles. This means it can potentially leach into groundwater and can be transported through water systems.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* Calcium Gluconate remains stable at high temperatures and is not affected by high temperatures during manufacturing processes. It can also withstand low temperatures, as well as freezing and thawing conditions, without any significant changes in its properties.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* The solubility and mobility of calcium gluconate are not significantly affected by pressure changes. It remains stable under normal atmospheric pressure as well as high pressures.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* The solubility of calcium gluconate is sensitive to pH levels. It is more soluble in alkaline conditions and less soluble in acidic conditions. This can impact its mobility and potential for leaching in different environments.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Calcium Gluconate has a molecular weight of 448.4 g/mol and a density of 1.59 g/cm³. It has a melting point of 154158°C and a boiling point of approximately 509°C. It is a noncorrosive substance and does not produce any significant gases at normal temperatures and pressures.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Calcium Gluconate is an important source of calcium, which is essential for strong bones, teeth, and proper functioning of the nervous, muscular, and cardiovascular systems. It is also used as an antidote for fluoride toxicity, as it helps to bind with fluoride ions and facilitate their excretion from the body.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* In addition to its use as a dietary supplement and medical treatment, calcium gluconate has various industrial applications. It is used as a nutrient source in food and beverage production, as an additive in cosmetics and personal care products, and as a stabilizer and acidifier in the textile and brewing industries. It is also used in wastewater treatment to control the pH levels and remove heavy metals from water.
