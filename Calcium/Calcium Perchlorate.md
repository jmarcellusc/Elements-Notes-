# Calcium Perchlorate
* 1. General Information
	* Calcium perchlorate is a chemical compound with the formula Ca(ClO4)2. It is a colorless, odorless, hygroscopic salt that is soluble in water and alcohol. It is primarily used as an oxidizing agent and in the production of fireworks.
* 2. Solubility
	* Calcium perchlorate has high solubility in water, with a solubility of 169.3 g/L at 25°C. It is also soluble in alcohol and other polar solvents.
* 3. Mobility
	* Calcium perchlorate has high mobility in most environmental conditions. It can easily dissolve in water and can be transported through soil and water systems. It does not readily bind to soil particles, making it mobile in soil environments.
* 4. Temperature Effects
	* At high temperatures, calcium perchlorate can decompose to produce oxygen and calcium chlorate. This decomposition typically occurs at temperatures above 400°C. At low temperatures, it can form hydrates and readily absorb moisture from the air.
* 5. Pressure Effects
	* Calcium perchlorate is stable under normal atmospheric pressure. However, at high pressures, it can ignite and decompose violently, producing toxic gases and heat.
* 6. pH Sensitivity
	* Calcium perchlorate has a neutral pH, and it is not sensitive to changes in pH.
* 7. Other Physical Properties
	* Calcium perchlorate is highly hygroscopic, which means it can readily absorb water from the air. It is a strong oxidizing agent and can react violently with reducing agents. It has a low melting point of 202°C and can produce toxic fumes when heated.
* 8. Biological Significance
	* Calcium perchlorate is toxic to plants and animals, and it can also contaminate food and water sources. It is not recommended for use in areas with sensitive ecosystems.
* 9. Industrial Applications
	* Calcium perchlorate is primarily used in the production of fireworks and pyrotechnics due to its strong oxidizing properties. It is also used as an oxidizer in rocket propellants and in the manufacture of other chemicals. In addition, it is used in analytical chemistry as a strong oxidizing agent.
