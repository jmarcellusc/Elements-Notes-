# Calcium Lactate
#### 1. General Information:
*  Calcium lactate is a calcium salt of lactic acid, with the chemical formula Ca(C3H5O3)2
*  It is a white crystalline solid, with a slightly acidic taste and odor
*  It is commonly found in dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt
*  It is also used as a food additive and in dietary supplements
*  Its melting point is around 180°C and it decomposes at higher temperatures
#### 2. Solubility:
*  Calcium lactate is highly soluble in water, with a solubility of 74 g/100 mL at 20°C
*  It is also soluble in ethanol and glycerol
*  Its solubility decreases with increasing temperature, with a solubility of 62 g/100 mL at 50°C
*  In soil, calcium lactate can be leached out by water, but its solubility is affected by factors such as pH and soil type
#### 3. Mobility:
*  In soil, calcium lactate can move down through the soil profile by water flow, but it has a low mobility due to its high solubility
*  Its mobility can be affected by soil properties, such as texture, organic matter content, and pH
*  In water, calcium lactate will move with the water flow, but it is not expected to persist in aquatic environments due to its biodegradability and low toxicity
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
*  At high temperatures, calcium lactate can undergo thermal decomposition, releasing carbon dioxide and lactic acid
*  Low temperatures do not have a significant effect on calcium lactate, but it may affect its solubility in water and other solvents
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
*  Calcium lactate is not significantly affected by pressure changes at normal environmental conditions
*  However, under high pressure, it may decompose into lactic acid and calcium carbonate
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
*  Calcium lactate has a slightly acidic pH, with a pKa of around 3.08
*  Its solubility is affected by pH, with higher solubility at lower pH levels
*  In soil, it may increase the acidity of the soil, depending on the amount added and the buffering capacity of the soil
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
*  Calcium lactate is hygroscopic, meaning it can absorb moisture from the air
*  It is a nontoxic compound and is generally considered safe for consumption
*  It is stable under normal environmental conditions, but can decompose in the presence of moisture and high temperatures
*  It is not expected to bioaccumulate in organisms
#### 8. Biological Significance:
*  Calcium lactate is an important source of calcium for humans and animals
*  It is used in the body for various functions, including bone and teeth formation, muscle contraction, and nerve transmission
*  It is also involved in enzyme reactions and cell signaling
*  It is generally considered safe for consumption in moderate amounts, but can cause gastrointestinal discomfort in high doses
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
*  Calcium lactate is used as a food additive, particularly as a calcium supplement
*  It can also be used in the production of pharmaceuticals, biodegradable plastics, and other industrial products
*  In agriculture, it can be added to soil as a fertilizer to provide nutrients for plants and improve soil properties
*  It is also used in cosmetics and personal care products as a moisturizing agent and pH adjuster.
