# Calcium Hypochlorites (Ca(ClO)₂)
#### 1. General Information:
* Calcium hypochlorite (Ca(ClO)2) is a white or light grey solid compound that is commercially available as a powder or granular form. 
* It is commonly used as a bleaching agent, disinfectant, and oxidizing agent in various industries. 
* In its dry form, it is stable and nonexplosive, but when mixed with water, it can release chlorine gas, which is toxic and corrosive.
#### 2. Solubility:
* The solubility of calcium hypochlorite depends on the temperature and the pH of the solution. 
* At room temperature, it is sparingly soluble in water, with a solubility of about 0.5 g/100 mL. 
* However, its solubility increases at higher temperatures, with a solubility of about 1.8 g/100 mL at 50°C. 
* At low pH levels, calcium hypochlorite is relatively stable, but as the pH increases, it decomposes rapidly, releasing chlorine gas.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Calcium hypochlorite can move through the environment through various routes including surface water, groundwater, and soil. 
* In water, it can be transported by currents and can spread to distant areas. 
* In soil, it can move through infiltration and leaching, but its mobility is limited due to its low solubility.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* The solubility and stability of calcium hypochlorite are affected by temperature. 
* As the temperature increases, its solubility increases, and it becomes more reactive. 
* In high temperature regimes, it can rapidly decompose, releasing chlorine gas. 
* In low temperature regimes, its decomposition and reactivity are significantly reduced.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* The pressure does not have a significant effect on the properties of calcium hypochlorite. 
* At high pressures, it remains stable and does not decompose or release any gases. 
* At low pressures, it may decompose slightly, but the process is very slow and does not pose any significant risks.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Calcium hypochlorite is highly pH sensitive, especially at high pH levels. 
* At low pH levels, it is relatively stable and does not decompose, but as the pH increases, it decomposes rapidly, releasing chlorine gas. 
* It is recommended to maintain a pH level below 11 when using calcium hypochlorite.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Other physical properties of calcium hypochlorite include its density, melting and boiling points, and odor.
* It has a density of about 2.35 g/cm3, a melting point of 100°C, and a boiling point of 175°C. 
* It has a strong odor and can irritate the eyes, skin, and respiratory system.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Calcium hypochlorite is toxic to aquatic organisms and can cause severe harm to fish and other aquatic life. 
* When released into the environment, it can also react with organic matter to form toxic byproducts. 
* Therefore, it should be handled and disposed of properly to prevent any ecological impacts.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Calcium hypochlorite has various industrial applications, including water treatment, wastewater treatment, bleaching textiles and paper, disinfection of swimming pools and spas, and as an oxidizing agent in chemical synthesis. 
* It is also used in agriculture as a pesticide and for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces and equipment.
