# Calcium Hydrogen Phosphate (CaHPO₄)
Calcium hydrogen phosphate (CaHPO₄) is a white crystalline compound with moderate solubility in water (~0.2 g/L at 25°C) and increased solubility in acidic environments, making it beneficial for plant growth. Its mobility in soil is moderate, allowing some movement in acidic conditions but limited in neutral to alkaline soils due to precipitation. It decomposes at temperatures above 500°C and is stable under normal pressure. This compound plays a crucial role in biological systems, contributing to bone and tooth formation, and is widely used in fertilizers, food additives, and dental applications. Its solubility and behavior are primarily influenced by pH and temperature.

## 1. General Information
- **Molecular Formula**: CaHPO₄
- **Molar Mass**: 136.09 g/mol
- **Appearance**: White crystalline powder
- **Common Forms**: Occurs as the mineral brushite and is commonly used in various industrial and biological applications.

## 2. Solubility
- **In Water**: Calcium hydrogen phosphate is moderately soluble in water, with a solubility of about 0.2 g/L at room temperature (25°C).
  - **Solubility in Water**: Increases slightly with temperature.
- **In Acids**: It dissolves readily in dilute acids, producing calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and phosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻).
- **In Bases**: It is less soluble in alkaline solutions, especially those with high hydroxide concentrations.

## 3. Mobility
- **Soil Mobility**: Calcium hydrogen phosphate has moderate mobility in soil. Its solubility allows for some movement through soil profiles, particularly in acidic conditions. In neutral to alkaline soils, its mobility is limited due to precipitation with calcium and phosphate ions.

## 4. Temperature Effects
- **Solubility & Temperature**: The solubility of calcium hydrogen phosphate increases with temperature, though the increase is modest. It remains stable at elevated temperatures but can decompose at very high temperatures (above 500°C) to form calcium phosphate and water.

## 5. Pressure Effects
Calcium hydrogen phosphate is stable under normal atmospheric pressure. However, like many minerals, it may exhibit changes in crystalline structure or stability under extreme pressures typically found in geological environments.

## 6. pH Sensitivity
- **In Acidic Conditions**: The compound dissolves well, enhancing the availability of calcium and phosphate ions, which is beneficial for plant growth and biological processes.
- **In Alkaline Conditions**: Its solubility decreases significantly in basic solutions, leading to precipitation as calcium phosphate compounds.

## 7. Other Physical Properties
- **Density**: ~2.3 g/cm³
- **Melting Point**: Decomposes before melting, typically around 150–200°C.
- **Lattice Structure**: Monoclinic crystal system.

## 8. Biological Significance
Calcium hydrogen phosphate plays an important role in biological systems as it contributes to the formation of bones and teeth. It serves as a precursor to hydroxyapatite (Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂), the primary mineral component of bone.

## 9. Industrial and Practical Applications
- **Fertilizers**: Used as a source of phosphorus in fertilizers.
- **Food Industry**: Acts as a calcium supplement and a firming agent in food products.
- **Dental and Bone Applications**: Utilized in dental cements and as a component in synthetic bone graft materials.
