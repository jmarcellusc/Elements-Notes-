# Calcium Propionate
#### 1. General information:
*  Calcium Propionate is the calcium salt of propionic acid.
*  Its molecular formula is C6H10CaO4 and it has a molar mass of 186.22 g/mol.
*  It is a white crystalline solid with a slight vinegary odor.
*  It is commonly used as a food additive and preservative in bread and other baked goods.
*  It has a low toxicity and is generally considered safe for consumption.
*  Calcium Propionate is also used in nonfood industries, such as in pharmaceuticals, feed and fertilizer additives, and as a mold inhibitor in some paints and coatings.
#### 2. Solubility:
*  Calcium Propionate has poor solubility in cold water, with a solubility of approximately 1 g per 50 mL of water at 25°C.
*  It is more soluble in hot water, with a solubility of approximately 7.5 g per 50 mL of water at 100°C.
*  It is also soluble in ethanol and may be sparingly soluble in other organic solvents.
*  In soil and rock, Calcium Propionate may undergo partial dissolution, but it is not expected to be highly mobile or leach into groundwater.
#### 3. Mobility:
*  Calcium Propionate may have some mobility in landfills or soil, but its degree of mobility depends on factors such as soil type, pH, and the presence of other substances.
*  It is not expected to have significant mobility in water bodies, as it is relatively insoluble in water.
*  In the atmosphere, Calcium Propionate is not volatile and will not undergo significant mobility.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
*  At high temperatures, Calcium Propionate may decompose to produce propionic acid and calcium carbonate.
*  This decomposition process may be accelerated under acidic conditions.
*  However, the decomposition of Calcium Propionate is unlikely to occur under normal ambient temperatures and is not a major concern in industrial or environmental settings.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
*  Calcium Propionate is not significantly affected by changes in pressure.
*  It has a melting point of 300350°C and does not undergo significant changes in properties under high pressures.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
*  Calcium Propionate is stable at a wide range of pH levels.
*  In acidic conditions, it may decompose to produce propionic acid and calcium carbonate, as mentioned earlier.
*  Its solubility may also be affected by pH, as it is more soluble in acidic solutions than in neutral or alkaline solutions.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
*  Calcium Propionate has a low vapor pressure and does not undergo significant evaporation or vaporization.
*  It has a melting point of 300350°C and a boiling point above 600°C.
*  It is relatively nonreactive and does not react with other substances under normal conditions.
*  It is not flammable or combustible.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
*  Calcium Propionate is generally considered safe for consumption and is widely used as a food additive and preservative.
*  In the body, it is metabolized to produce propionic acid, which is naturally occurring and is also present in the gut microbiome.
*  High levels of Calcium Propionate intake have not been linked to any major health concerns, but some people may experience digestive discomfort or allergic reactions.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
*  Calcium Propionate is commonly used in the food industry as a preservative for bread and other baked goods.
*  It is also used as a mold inhibitor in some paints and coatings.
*  In the agriculture industry, it is used as a feed and fertilizer additive to prevent the growth of mold and bacteria.
*  It may also be used in the pharmaceutical industry as an excipient in oral tablets and capsules.
