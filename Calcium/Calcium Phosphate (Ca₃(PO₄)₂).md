# Calcium Phosphate (Ca₃(PO₄)₂) Properties

## 1. General Information
- **Molecular Formula**: Ca₃(PO₄)₂
- **Molar Mass**: 310.18 g/mol
- **Appearance**: White crystalline solid or powder
- **Common Forms**: Natural mineral whitlockite; prevalent in biological systems as hydroxyapatite (Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂).

## 2. Solubility
- **In Water**: Calcium phosphate has very low solubility in water, approximately 0.002 g/L at 25°C.
- **In Acids**: It dissolves significantly in dilute acids (e.g., HCl), forming soluble calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and phosphate ions (PO₄³⁻).
- **In Bases**: Its solubility decreases in alkaline solutions, resulting in precipitation as calcium phosphate compounds.

## 3. Mobility
- **Soil Mobility**:
  - **Low Mobility**: In neutral and alkaline soils, calcium phosphate is largely immobile due to its low solubility, primarily remaining as a solid.
  - **In Acidic Soils**: Mobility increases in acidic conditions where it becomes more soluble, allowing calcium and phosphate ions to move through the soil profile.
- **Rock Mobility**: Found in sedimentary and igneous rock formations, calcium phosphate exhibits limited mobility. Weathering processes, particularly in acidic environments, can release calcium and phosphate ions into the soil or water systems.
- **Atmospheric Mobility**: Calcium phosphate does not exist in gaseous form, so it has negligible mobility in the atmosphere. However, dust containing calcium phosphate can be transported over short distances from soil or industrial activities.
- **Water Mobility**: Mobility in water is also low due to its very low solubility. In neutral to alkaline waters, it tends to precipitate, while in acidic conditions, some dissolution occurs, releasing calcium and phosphate ions.

## 4. Temperature Effects
- **Low Temperature**: At low temperatures (close to freezing), calcium phosphate remains stable. Its solubility does not significantly increase with lower temperatures.
- **High Temperature**: The solubility may slightly increase with temperature, but calcium phosphate is stable up to approximately 800°C. Beyond this temperature, it can decompose into calcium oxide (CaO) and phosphorus oxides (P₂O₅).

## 5. Pressure Effects
- **Normal Pressure**: Under normal atmospheric conditions, calcium phosphate remains stable and maintains its solid form.
- **High Pressure**: At very high pressures (found in deep geological formations), calcium phosphate may undergo structural changes, potentially transforming into different polymorphic forms of calcium phosphate.

## 6. pH Sensitivity
- **In Acidic Conditions**: Dissolves well, enhancing the availability of calcium and phosphate ions.
- **In Alkaline Conditions**: Solubility decreases significantly, leading to precipitation.

## 7. Other Physical Properties
- **Density**: ~3.14 g/cm³
- **Melting Point**: Decomposes at temperatures above 1670°C, typically without a distinct melting phase.
- **Lattice Structure**: Trigonal or monoclinic crystal systems, depending on its polymorphic form.

## 8. Biological Significance
Calcium phosphate is vital in biological systems, particularly in the formation of bones and teeth, contributing to hydroxyapatite's structure, which provides strength and durability.

## 9. Industrial and Practical Applications
- **Fertilizers**: Used as a phosphorus source in fertilizers due to its slow-release properties.
- **Dental and Bone Applications**: Biocompatible material in synthetic bone grafts and dental procedures.
- **Food Additives**: Acts as a nutritional supplement and anti-caking agent.
