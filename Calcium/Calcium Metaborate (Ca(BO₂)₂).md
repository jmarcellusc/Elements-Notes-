# Calcium Metaborate (Ca(BO₂)₂)
#### 1. General Information:
* Calcium metaborate (Ca(BO2)2) is a chemical compound composed of calcium, boron, and oxygen. (Ca(BO₂)₂).
* It is a white, odorless solid with a melting point of 966°C and a boiling point of 2015°C. 
* It is commonly found in nature as the mineral tinkalite.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Calcium metaborate is moderately soluble in water, with a solubility of about 1.8 g/L at room temperature. 
* It is more soluble in acidic solutions, with the solubility increasing as the pH decreases. 
* This compound is also quite soluble in organic solvents such as alcohol and acetone.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Calcium metaborate can be relatively mobile in soils and waters depending on the conditions. 
* In well drained soils, it can leach out with water, especially in acidic environments. 
* It is also easily transported in water bodies due to its solubility.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* At high temperatures, calcium metaborate can decompose to form calcium oxide and boric acid. This decomposition occurs at temperatures above 966°C. 
* At low temperatures, the compound is stable and does not undergo any significant changes.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Calcium metaborate is not significantly affected by changes in pressure. However, at high pressures, its solubility may slightly increase due to the compressibility of water.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Calcium metaborate is relatively insensitive to changes in pH, with its solubility remaining fairly constant over a wide pH range. 
* However, it is more soluble in acidic environments, as mentioned earlier.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Apart from its solubility and mobility, calcium metaborate has some other physical properties that are of interest. These include its refractive index (1.54), density (2.91 g/cm3), and hardness (4.55 on the Mohs scale).
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Calcium metaborate does not have a significant role in biological processes. 
* However, it may act as a nutrient for some plants as it contains both calcium and boron, which are essential elements for plant growth.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Calcium metaborate has several industrial applications. 
* It is commonly used as a flux in metallurgy to lower the melting point of metals, such as steel and aluminum. 
* It is also used in the production of glass, ceramics, and insecticides. 
* In addition, it is used as a source of boron in the production of boron compounds.
