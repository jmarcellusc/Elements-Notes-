# Calcium Carbide
#### 1. General Information:
* Calcium carbide (CaC2) is an inorganic compound that is commonly used in the production of acetylene gas, which is used in a variety of industrial processes. It is a grayishwhite crystalline solid with a chemical formula of CaC2 and a molar mass of 64.10 g/mol. It is soluble in water and has a melting point of 2160°C.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Calcium carbide is highly soluble in water, with a solubility of 47.7 g/100 mL at 25°C. This means that at room temperature, almost half of the substance will dissolve in water. However, as the temperature increases, its solubility also increases, with a solubility of 66.2 g/100 mL at 60°C. It is also slightly soluble in alcohol and insoluble in organic solvents such as ether, acetone, and benzene.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Calcium carbide is not considered to be a mobile compound in soil, rock, or water. It tends to remain in the place where it is deposited and does not easily move through the environment.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* Calcium carbide is stable at high temperatures and does not undergo any significant changes in its structure or properties. It has a melting point of 2160°C and starts decomposing at temperatures above 400°C. However, at extremely high temperatures, it can react violently with water to produce acetylene gas, which is highly flammable.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Under normal ambient conditions, calcium carbide does not undergo any changes in its properties in response to pressure. However, at very high pressures, it can undergo violent reactions with water, releasing a large amount of acetylene gas. This is a potential safety hazard and precautions should be taken when handling calcium carbide under high pressure conditions.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Calcium carbide is an alkaline compound and can increase the pH of water or soil when it comes into contact with them. This can have negative effects on the surrounding ecosystem, particularly for organisms that are sensitive to changes in pH levels.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* In its pure form, calcium carbide is a hard, brittle solid with a density of 2.22 g/cm3. It reacts with water to produce acetylene gas, which has a strong garliclike odor. It is a good conductor of electricity and has a high heat of formation, making it a useful material for industrial processes such as welding and cutting.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Calcium carbide does not have any beneficial biological effects and can be toxic to plants and animals if ingested in large quantities. When it reacts with water, it produces acetylene gas, which can be harmful to aquatic life if it accumulates in bodies of water.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Calcium carbide is primarily used in the production of acetylene gas, which has a variety of industrial uses such as welding and cutting. It is also used in the production of various chemicals, including calcium cyanamide, which is used as a fertilizer. In addition, calcium carbide is used as a desulfurizing agent in the steel industry.
