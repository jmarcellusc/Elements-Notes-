# Calcium Peroxide
#### 1. General information:
*  Chemical formula -  CaO2
*  Molecular weight:
72.08 g/mol
*  Appearance:
white or pale yellow powder
*  Density:
2.91 g/cm3
*  Melting point:
439 째C (822 째F; 712 K)
*  Boiling point:
decomposes before boiling
*  Solubility:
slightly soluble in water, soluble in acids and organic solvents
*  Stability:
Calcium peroxide is stable under normal conditions, but can decompose to form calcium hydroxide and oxygen gas under high temperatures.
*  Calcium peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent and should be handled with caution.
#### 2. Solubility:
*  Calcium peroxide is slightly soluble in water, with a solubility of 0.43 g/L at 25 째C.
*  It is more soluble in acidic solutions, with solubility increasing as pH decreases.
*  It is insoluble in organic solvents.
#### 3. Mobility:
*  Calcium peroxide is not mobile in soil, as it strongly binds to soil particles.
*  In water, it can be transported through natural water systems, but its mobility is limited due to low solubility.
*  In the atmosphere, calcium peroxide can become airborne through dust particles, but it is quickly deposited back onto the ground.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
*  Calcium peroxide is relatively stable at low temperatures, but can decompose at temperatures above 150 째C.
*  At high temperatures, it decomposes to form calcium hydroxide and oxygen gas.
*  In soil and water, temperature does not have a significant effect on the solubility or mobility of calcium peroxide.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
*  High pressure does not have a significant effect on the properties of calcium peroxide.
*  However, at extremely high pressures, it may decompose more quickly due to the increased concentration of oxygen gas.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
*  Calcium peroxide is most stable at a neutral pH, with a pH range of 68.
*  It becomes less stable at both lower and higher pH levels.
*  In acidic conditions, it can decompose more quickly, releasing oxygen gas.
*  In alkaline conditions, it can also decompose, releasing hydroxide ions and oxygen gas.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
*  Calcium peroxide has a high melting point, making it useful as a source of oxygen in high temperature reactions.
*  It is also highly reactive, with a strong tendency to oxidize other compounds.
*  It can generate oxygen gas when exposed to water or acids.
*  It has a low vapor pressure, meaning it does not readily evaporate into the air.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
*  Calcium peroxide is not toxic to most living organisms.
*  It can act as a source of oxygen in water systems, which can benefit aquatic organisms.
*  However, large amounts of calcium peroxide can cause oxygen depletion in water, which can harm aquatic life.
*  It is used in some agricultural applications as an oxygen release agent, but it can also harm plant roots in high concentrations.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
*  Calcium peroxide is commonly used as a source of oxygen in industrial applications such as bleaching, disinfection, and waste water treatment.
*  It is also used in the production of detergents, paper, and textiles.
*  In agriculture, it is used as a soil treatment to improve the release of nutrients and control soil compaction.
*  It is also used as a source of oxygen in explosives and pyrotechnics.
