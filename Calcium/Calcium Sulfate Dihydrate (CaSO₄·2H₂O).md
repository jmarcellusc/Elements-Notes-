# Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO₄·2H₂O)
**Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO₄·2H₂O)**, commonly known as **gypsum**, is a **sparingly soluble** and **moderately mobile** compound in water. It is widely used in **construction**, **agriculture**, and **environmental remediation**. Gypsum is stable under **ambient conditions** but will dehydrate to form calcium sulfate hemihydrate at temperatures above **150°C**, and further to **anhydrite** at even higher temperatures. Its **neutral pH** and **low solubility** make it an ideal soil conditioner, providing essential **calcium** and **sulfur** without altering soil pH significantly.
## General Properties of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO₄·2H₂O)

* **Chemical Formula:** CaSO₄·2H₂O
* **Molar Mass:** 172.17 g/mol
* **Appearance:** White or colorless crystalline solid or powder
* **Odor:** Odorless
* **Density:** 2.32 g/cm³
* **Hardness:** 2 on the Mohs scale (soft, easily scratched)
* **Melting Point:** Decomposes around 150°C, losing its water of hydration and transforming into calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO₄·½H₂O)
* **Boiling Point:** Does not boil; decomposes instead

## Solubility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO₄·2H₂O)

### In Water
* **Sparingly Soluble:** Gypsum is sparingly soluble in water, with a solubility of about 2.4 g/L at 25°C.
* **Solubility decreases slightly with increasing temperature.**
* **Temperature Dependence:**
    * Solubility tends to decrease slightly as temperature increases due to the reduced capacity of water to hold calcium and sulfate ions.
    * At higher temperatures (above 50°C), the solubility decreases as calcium sulfate starts transitioning toward the less soluble anhydrite (CaSO₄) form.

### In Acids
* **More Soluble in Acids:** Gypsum is more soluble in acidic solutions, particularly sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), where it forms soluble calcium salts.

### In Organic Solvents
* **Insoluble:** Gypsum is insoluble in most organic solvents, such as alcohol or acetone.

## Mobility of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO₄·2H₂O)

### In Water
* **Moderately Mobile:** Gypsum has limited mobility in water due to its low solubility.

### In Soil
* **Low Mobility:** Gypsum can be used as a soil amendment to improve soil structure and drainage, but its low solubility means that it is relatively stable in the soil and does not leach quickly.

### In Air
* Gypsum does not become airborne unless it is in powdered form.

## Behavior Under Temperature and Pressure

### At High Temperatures
* **Dehydration:** When heated to 150°C, gypsum loses water and converts to calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO₄·½H₂O), also known as Plaster of Paris.
* **Thermal Decomposition:** If heated beyond 1,450°C, anhydrite decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂).

### At Low Temperatures
* Gypsum is stable at low temperatures.

### Pressure Effects
* **High Pressure:** Under high-pressure conditions, gypsum may slowly convert to anhydrite.
* **Low Pressure:** At low or atmospheric pressures, gypsum remains stable.

## Chemical Properties

* **Reactivity with Water:** Gypsum can dissolve in water, releasing calcium (Ca²⁺) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻) ions.
* **Neutral pH:** Gypsum is a neutral salt in water.
* **Reactivity with Acids and Bases:** Gypsum dissolves more readily in acidic solutions.

## Industrial and Environmental Applications

* **Construction:** Gypsum is a major component in drywall and plaster.
* **Agriculture:** Gypsum is used as a soil amendment.
* **Environmental Remediation:** Gypsum is used in the treatment of acidic soils and acid mine drainage.

## Safety Considerations

* **Non-toxic:** Gypsum is non-toxic.
* **Inhalation:** Gypsum dust may cause respiratory irritation.
* **Contact with Skin and Eyes:** Contact with gypsum is generally safe.

**Summary**

Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO₄·2H₂O), commonly known as gypsum, is a sparingly soluble and moderately mobile compound in water. It is widely used in construction, agriculture, and environmental remediation. Gypsum is stable under ambient conditions but will dehydrate to form calcium sulfate hemihydrate at temperatures.
