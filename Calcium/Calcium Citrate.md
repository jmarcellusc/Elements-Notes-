# Calcium Citrate
#### 1. General Information:
* Calcium citrate is a calcium salt of citric acid, and is commonly used as a dietary supplement to provide calcium to the body. It is also used as a food additive in some processed foods. Chemically, it is represented by the formula Ca3(C6H5O7)2 and has a molar mass of 498.44 g/mol.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Calcium citrate is highly watersoluble, with a solubility of approximately 21 g/L at room temperature. It can also dissolve in other polar solvents such as glycerol and acetic acid.
#### 3. Mobility:
* In soil, calcium citrate has low mobility due to its high solubility. It can easily leach out of the soil profile and into groundwater. In rock formations, calcium citrate has low mobility as it is not easily soluble in nonpolar solvents. However, in the atmosphere, it can be transported long distances by winds and dissolved into rainwater.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* At high temperatures, calcium citrate may decompose and lose its citrate ions, forming insoluble calcium carbonate. This can happen when the temperature exceeds 200°C. At low temperatures, calcium citrate remains stable and its solubility is not significantly affected.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* At high pressures, calcium citrate remains stable. However, under extreme pressures (over 1 GPa), it can be compressed and form different crystal structures.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Calcium citrate is relatively insensitive to pH changes in the range of 39. It remains soluble at these pH levels, with a slight decrease in solubility at lower pH values. This makes it a suitable source of calcium for neutral and slightly acidic soils.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Calcium citrate is a white crystalline powder with a slightly acidic taste. It has a melting point of approximately 153°C and a boiling point of about 310°C. It is odorless and nontoxic, making it safe for human consumption.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Calcium citrate is an important source of calcium for maintaining healthy bones and teeth. It also plays a role in muscle and nerve function, blood clotting, and enzyme activity. As a food additive, it can be used as a preservative and to provide a tart taste in certain foods.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Apart from its use in dietary supplements and food additives, calcium citrate also has industrial applications. It is used as a chelating agent in the production of certain antibiotics and as a leavening agent in baked goods. It is also used in the production of cosmetics and personal care products. Furthermore, it is commonly used in agriculture as a foliar spray to correct calcium deficiencies in plants.
