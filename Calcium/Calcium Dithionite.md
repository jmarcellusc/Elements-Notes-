# Calcium Dithionite
#### 1. General information:
* Calcium dithionite, also known as calcium hydrosulfite or CaS2O4, is a white crystalline solid compound with a chemical formula of Ca(OH)2S2O4. It is an alkaline compound and is highly soluble in water. It is mainly used as a reducing agent in various industrial processes, such as bleaching and water treatment. It is also used in the production of paper, textiles, and food products.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Calcium dithionite is highly soluble in water, with a solubility of 143g/100ml at 20°C. It is also slightly soluble in alcohol and insoluble in most organic solvents.
#### 3. Mobility:
* In soil, calcium dithionite is highly mobile due to its water solubility. It can easily leach down into the deeper layers of the soil and even contaminate groundwater if not managed properly.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* The solubility of calcium dithionite decreases as temperature increases. At high temperatures, the compound can decompose to release sulfur dioxide gas. On the other hand, at low temperatures, it may form insoluble precipitates, reducing its mobility.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Calcium dithionite is not significantly affected by changes in pressure. However, at very high pressures, it may decompose to release sulfur dioxide gas.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* The solubility of calcium dithionite is pHdependent, with higher solubility at lower pH levels. At higher pH levels, the compound may decompose to release sulfur dioxide gas.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Calcium dithionite has a melting point of 90°C and a boiling point of 350°C. It is odorless and has a sweetish taste. It can also act as a mild acid when mixed with water.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Calcium dithionite is not known to have any biological significance. However, it can be toxic to aquatic organisms if released into the environment in high concentrations.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Calcium dithionite is primarily used as a reducing agent in various industrial processes. It is commonly used in the textile industry for bleaching and printing fabrics. It is also used in the production of paper, where it acts as a bleaching agent and helps in the removal of lignin from wood pulp. In addition, it is used in water treatment as a dechlorinating agent and in food processing as a food additive for preserving color and preventing oxidation.
