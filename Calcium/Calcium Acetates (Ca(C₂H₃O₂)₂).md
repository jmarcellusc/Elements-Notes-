# Calcium Acetates (Ca(C₂H₃O₂)₂)
#### 1. General Information:
* Calcium acetate is a chemical compound with the formula Ca(C2H3O2)2. 
* It is a white, odorless solid that is highly soluble in water and polar organic solvents.
* It is commonly used as a food additive and also has various industrial and pharmaceutical applications.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Calcium acetate is highly soluble in water, with a solubility of 1190 g/L at 20°C. 
* Its solubility decreases slightly as the temperature increases. 
* It is also soluble in polar organic solvents such as ethanol, methanol, and acetone.
#### 3. Mobility:
* In soil, calcium acetate has low mobility due to its strong adsorption onto soil particles. 
* This makes it relatively immobile and nontoxic to plants. 
* In water, it is relatively mobile due to its high solubility and low adsorption onto suspended particles. 
* It is not expected to travel long distances through water systems.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* Calcium acetate is stable over a wide range of temperatures and can withstand high temperatures without decomposition. 
* At high temperatures, it can decompose to form acetic acid and calcium carbonate.
* In general, its solubility and mobility decrease slightly as temperature increases.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Pressure does not have a significant effect on calcium acetate. 
* The compound remains stable and its solubility and mobility do not change significantly under high pressure.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Calcium acetate is neutral in solution and does not have a significant impact on pH. 
* However, when dissolved in water, it will slightly increase the pH due to the release of acetate ions.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Calcium acetate has a melting point of 160°C and a density of 1.5 g/cm3. 
* It is odorless, nonvolatile, and nontoxic to humans and animals.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Calcium acetate is naturally found in some plants and is nontoxic to humans. 
* It is commonly used as a food additive, particularly as a souring agent in sour candies. 
* In pharmaceuticals, it is used as an antacid and a calcium supplement.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Calcium acetate has various industrial applications. 
* It is used as a catalyst in organic reactions, as a stabilizer in resins and coatings, and as a source of calcium ions in wastewater treatment.
* It is also used in the production of textiles, paper, and plastics.
