## Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate (CaSO₄·½H₂O)

Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate (CaSO₄·½H₂O), commonly known as Plaster of Paris, is a partially dehydrated form of gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O). It has unique physical and chemical properties, making it essential in a variety of industrial applications, particularly in construction and molding. Below is a detailed description of its solubility, mobility, and various properties, along with its behavior under different temperature and pressure regimes.

### 1. General Properties of Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate (CaSO₄·½H₂O)

* **Chemical Formula:** CaSO₄·½H₂O
* **Molar Mass:** 145.15 g/mol
* **Forms:** Commonly found as a fine white powder.
* **Appearance:** White crystalline or powdery solid.
* **Odor:** Odorless.
* **Density:** 2.75 g/cm³
* **Hardness:** Hemihydrate is soft in powder form, but hardens when mixed with water.
* **Melting Point:** Does not melt; instead, it decomposes at elevated temperatures into calcium sulfate anhydrite (CaSO₄).

### 2. Solubility of Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate (CaSO₄·½H₂O)

* **In Water:**
    * Sparingly Soluble: The solubility of calcium sulfate hemihydrate in water is around 0.24 g/100 mL at 20°C. This is relatively low, similar to the solubility of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum), though slightly higher due to its partial hydration.
    * When mixed with water, hemihydrate readily dissolves, but soon begins to react with the water and reverts to the dihydrate form (gypsum) in an exothermic crystallization process:

    ```
    CaSO₄·½H₂O + 1.5H₂O → CaSO₄·2H₂O
    ```

* **In Acids:**
    * Slightly More Soluble: Like other forms of calcium sulfate, the hemihydrate is slightly more soluble in strong acids (e.g., sulfuric acid) than in pure water due to the formation of soluble calcium salts.
* **In Organic Solvents:**
    * Insoluble: Calcium sulfate hemihydrate is insoluble in most organic solvents like alcohol, acetone, and organic oils.

### 3. Mobility of Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate (CaSO₄·½H₂O)

* **In Water:**
    * Moderately Mobile: Calcium sulfate hemihydrate has limited mobility in water due to its low solubility. However, when added to water, it dissolves and immediately hydrates back into calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum).
    * Hardening Process: This conversion is a key property in its use for casting molds, plastering, and construction, as the powdery hemihydrate sets into a solid gypsum structure when rehydrated.
* **In Soil:**
    * Calcium sulfate hemihydrate applied to soils will quickly hydrate into gypsum. Once in its gypsum form, it becomes relatively immobile in soil due to its low solubility and stays in place to improve soil structure and drainage.
    * In terms of soil amendment, the mobility of calcium ions from calcium sulfate hemihydrate is beneficial for displacing sodium ions in sodic soils, improving soil quality and water penetration.
* **In Air:**
    * In powdered form, calcium sulfate hemihydrate is easily airborne, especially during handling and transportation. However, once it hardens into its gypsum form, it becomes a solid and immobile material.

### 4. Behavior Under Temperature and Pressure

* **At High Temperatures:**
    * **Dehydration:** Hemihydrate itself is a partially dehydrated form of calcium sulfate. If subjected to temperatures above 150°C, it can further lose its remaining water, forming anhydrite (CaSO₄):

    ```
    CaSO₄·½H₂O → CaSO₄ + ½H₂O
    ```

    * **Thermal Stability:** Beyond 200°C, calcium sulfate becomes increasingly anhydrous, eventually converting fully to anhydrite (CaSO₄). This process is irreversible under normal conditions unless water is reintroduced.
* **At Low Temperatures:**
    * Calcium sulfate hemihydrate is stable at low temperatures but will quickly rehydrate in the presence of liquid water, turning back into gypsum.
* **Pressure Effects:**
    * Under high pressure, calcium sulfate does not undergo significant chemical changes, but pressure and temperature can influence the transition between its different hydrated forms. Anhydrite is more stable than hemihydrate or gypsum at higher pressures and temperatures, making it the predominant form in deep geological environments.

### 5. Chemical Properties

* **Rehydration Reaction:**
    * One of the defining characteristics of calcium sulfate hemihydrate is its ability to quickly rehydrate to form gypsum. This reaction is exothermic (releases heat) and forms a solid, hardened material used in construction, dentistry, and art.
* **Neutral pH:**
    * Calcium sulfate hemihydrate is a neutral salt, meaning it does not significantly alter the pH of its environment, unlike calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂), which is alkaline.
* **Low Reactivity:**
    * Chemically, calcium sulfate hemihydrate is fairly stable and does not react vigorously with other compounds. It behaves similarly to gypsum in most chemical environments, except it is more reactive with water due to its hemihydrate state.
* **Interaction with Acids and Bases:**
    * Calcium sulfate hemihydrate is stable in both acidic and basic conditions. However, in strong acids, it can form more soluble calcium salts, and in very basic conditions, it remains largely unreactive but can promote the precipitation of calcium ions.

### 6. Industrial and Environmental Applications

* **Construction:**
    * **Plaster of Paris:** One of the most common applications of calcium sulfate hemihydrate is as Plaster of Paris, used for molding, casting, plastering, and drywall production.
* **Dental and Medical Uses:**
    * In dentistry and orthopedics, calcium sulfate hemihydrate is used to create casts and molds for setting broken bones or forming dental impressions.
* **Agriculture:**
    * **Soil Amendment:** Although less commonly used than gypsum, calcium sulfate hemihydrate can be used as a soil conditioner to improve water infiltration and reduce soil salinity.

### 7. Safety Considerations

* **Inhalation:** Fine powders like Plaster of Paris (hemihydrate) can be inhaled, which may cause respiratory irritation. Proper dust control and personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used when handling the material.
* **Ingestion:** Non-toxic in small amounts, but ingestion of large quantities may cause digestive discomfort.
* **Contact with Skin/Eyes:** Can cause mild irritation on prolonged contact with skin or eyes. When mixed with water, the exothermic reaction may generate heat, which could lead to minor burns if prolonged contact occurs.

Calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO₄·½H₂O), or Plaster of Paris, is a versatile material that hydrates quickly when mixed with water, forming solid gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O). It is sparingly soluble in water, with its solubility slightly influenced by temperature. Widely used in construction, art, and medical applications, it hardens into a stable form when rehydrated. Hemihydrate has limited mobility in natural environments but is useful as a soil amendment. It remains stable under normal pressure and temperature, but decomposes to anhydrite at higher temperatures.
