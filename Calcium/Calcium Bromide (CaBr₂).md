# Calcium Bromide (CaBr₂)
#### 1. General Information:
*  Calcium Bromide (CaBr2) is an inorganic salt composed of calcium and bromine.
*  It is a white crystalline solid with a density of 3.353 g/cm3.
*  Its chemical formula is CaBr2.
*  It is highly soluble in water, alcohol, and acetone.
*  Calcium bromide is produced by reacting calcium carbonate with hydrobromic acid, or by reacting calcium metal with bromine gas.
*  It is commonly used in various industrial and medical applications.
#### 2. Solubility:
*  Calcium bromide has a high solubility in water, with a solubility of 74.5 g/100 mL at 25°C and 121 g/100 mL at 100°C.
*  It also has a high solubility in other polar solvents such as alcohol and acetone.
*  However, its solubility decreases as temperature decreases.
*  At low temperatures, calcium bromide can form a hydrate, which further decreases its solubility.
*  Its solubility is not affected by pH.
#### 3. Mobility:
*  Calcium bromide is highly mobile in water, as it can dissolve easily and rapidly.
*  It is less mobile in soil and rock, as the solid crystals may bind to soil particles or be held in the pore spaces.
*  In the atmosphere, calcium bromide can be transported through evaporation from bodies of water or as a component of sea spray.
*  It can also be carried as a dust particle, but is easily deposited back to the surface.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
*  The solubility of calcium bromide decreases as temperature decreases.
*  At low temperatures, it can form a hydrate, which decreases its solubility even further.
*  However, calcium bromide remains stable at high temperatures and does not decompose.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
*  The solubility of calcium bromide in water is not significantly affected by pressure.
*  However, at high pressures, the formation of hydrates may be favored, leading to lower solubility.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
*  Calcium bromide is not pHsensitive, as its solubility is not affected by changes in pH.
*  It remains stable and soluble in both acidic and basic conditions.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
*  Calcium bromide has a high melting and boiling point (730°C and 806°C respectively), indicating its stability at high temperatures.
*  It is slightly hygroscopic, meaning it can absorb water from the atmosphere.
*  It is also deliquescent, meaning it can absorb enough water to dissolve and form a solution.
*  When heated to high temperatures, calcium bromide can emit toxic fumes.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
*  Calcium bromide is not naturally present in living organisms.
*  It can be toxic in high concentrations, causing harm to aquatic organisms.
*  However, in small doses, it is used as an anticonvulsant and in pharmaceuticals.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
*  Calcium bromide has various industrial applications, such as in drilling fluids for oil and gas exploration.
*  It is also used as a dehydrating agent, flame retardant, and for the production of other bromine compounds.
*  In the medical field, it is used in the treatment of epilepsy and as a sedative.
*  Calcium bromide is also used in photography, textile and paper industries, and as a catalyst in organic reactions.
