## Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃)

Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃), often found as limestone, chalk, or marble, is a common chemical compound. Known for its role in everything from construction to medicine (antacids), it's a fundamental material on Earth's surface. Here's a breakdown of its solubility, mobility, and other properties, especially as they vary under different temperature and pressure regimes.

### 1. General Properties of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃)

* **Chemical Formula:** CaCO₃
* **Molar Mass:** 100.09 g/mol
* **Appearance:** White or colorless crystalline solid, often found as rock.
* **Odor:** Odorless
* **Density:**
    * Calcite form: 2.71 g/cm³
    * Aragonite form: 2.93 g/cm³
* **Melting Point:** Decomposes at around 825°C (1,517°F)
* **Boiling Point:** Does not boil, decomposes instead
* **Hardness:** 3 on the Mohs scale (fairly soft mineral)
* **Polymorphs:** Occurs naturally as calcite, aragonite, and vaterite, with calcite being the most stable.

### 2. Solubility of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃)

* **In Water:**
    * Calcium carbonate is sparingly soluble in pure water. Its solubility is heavily influenced by the presence of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the water:
        * In pure water: ~0.013 g/L at 25°C (almost insoluble).
        * In acidic water, or water with CO₂, solubility increases due to the formation of calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO₃)₂):

    ```
    CaCO₃ + H₂O + CO₂ → Ca(HCO₃)₂
    ```

    * Calcium bicarbonate is soluble in water, which explains why limestone caves form — as slightly acidic rainwater dissolves calcium carbonate over time.
    * Temperature trend of solubility of calcium carbonate in water
	    * **Lower Temperatures**: Calcium carbonate is slightly more soluble
	    * **Higher Temperatures**: The solubility of calcium carbonate decreases
* **In Acids:**
    * Calcium carbonate readily dissolves in acids, forming carbon dioxide gas, water, and the corresponding calcium salt:

    ```
    CaCO₃ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + H₂O + CO₂ ↑
    ```

    * This reaction is why antacids, made from calcium carbonate, help neutralize stomach acid, releasing CO₂ in the process.
* **In Organic Solvents:**
    * Insoluble in organic solvents like alcohol, ether, or acetone.

### 3. Mobility of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃)

* **In Water:**
    * In neutral or slightly basic water, calcium carbonate remains relatively immobile due to its low solubility. However, in acidic waters or water rich in carbon dioxide, it dissolves and forms calcium bicarbonate, which can be mobile and leach through soil, rocks, and groundwater systems. This explains the erosion of limestone landscapes and the formation of geological features like stalactites and stalagmites.
* **In Soil:**
    * Calcium carbonate in soils acts as a buffer for soil pH. In alkaline soils, it stays stable and immobile. However, in acidic soils, it can dissolve, especially if there is carbonic acid formed from rainwater and CO₂. This slow dissolution is crucial for neutralizing acidic soils (agricultural lime).
* **In Air:**
    * Calcium carbonate does not sublimate or become airborne under normal conditions. However, in particulate form (as dust), it can be airborne, contributing to particulate matter in the environment if disturbed.

### 4. Behavior Under Temperature and Pressure

* **At High Temperatures:**
    * Decomposition: Calcium carbonate begins to decompose at around 825°C into calcium oxide (CaO) (quicklime) and carbon dioxide (CO₂):

    ```
    CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ ↑
    ```

    * This reaction is used in industries such as cement manufacturing and lime production.
* **At Low Temperatures:**
    * Calcium carbonate remains stable at low temperatures, showing no significant changes in structure or solubility.
* **Pressure Effects:**
    * Increased pressure generally enhances the stability of calcium carbonate, especially in deep-earth or marine environments where aragonite (a denser form of CaCO₃) becomes more stable than calcite.
    * In geological settings, high pressures combined with CO₂ can lead to the formation of calcium carbonate deposits in sedimentary rock layers, particularly in carbonate reefs or caves.
* **Polymorph Stability:**
    * Under different temperature and pressure regimes, calcium carbonate can take on different crystalline forms:
        * **Calcite:** Most stable under normal temperature and pressure.
        * **Aragonite:** Stable at higher pressures (often found in marine environments and in shells).
        * **Vaterite:** The least stable polymorph, quickly converting to calcite or aragonite over time.

### 5. Chemical Properties

* **Basicity:** Calcium carbonate is a weak base and reacts with acids to produce CO₂ gas and calcium salts. This makes it useful in neutralizing acidic environments, whether in soil, water, or industrial waste streams.
* **Reactivity with CO₂:**
    * In the presence of water and CO₂, calcium carbonate can dissolve to form calcium bicarbonate:

    ```
    CaCO₃ + H₂O + CO₂ → Ca(HCO₃)₂
    ```

    * In contrast, calcium carbonate will precipitate out of solution when carbon dioxide is removed (e.g., in ocean water when CO₂ is consumed by organisms):

    ```
    Ca(HCO₃)₂ → CaCO₃ + H₂O + CO₂ ↑
    ```

### 6. Industrial and Environmental Applications

* **Construction:**
    * **Cement and Concrete:** Calcium carbonate is a key raw material in the production of Portland cement and lime mortar.
    * **Limestone Aggregate:** Used as an aggregate in construction for roads, building foundations, and other structural applications.
* **Water Treatment:**
    * **Neutralization:** Calcium carbonate is used to neutralize acidic water and remove impurities by causing precipitation of dissolved metals.
* **Soil Amendment:**
    * **Agricultural lime:** Finely ground calcium carbonate is used to neutralize acidic soils, improving conditions for plant growth.
* **Environmental Remediation:**
    * **Acidic Mine Drainage:** Calcium carbonate can be used to neutralize acidic runoff and precipitate heavy metals.

### 7. Safety Considerations

* **Ingestion:** Calcium carbonate is non-toxic and is often used in food (e.g., as a calcium supplement).
* **Inhalation:** Dust from calcium carbonate, if inhaled, can cause irritation of the respiratory tract. Proper ventilation and dust control measures should be in place when handling finely powdered forms.
* **Contact with Skin/Eyes:** Non-corrosive, but prolonged exposure to large amounts of dust can cause mechanical irritation.
