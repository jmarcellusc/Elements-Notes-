# Calcium Silicate (Ca₂SiO₄ or CaSiO₃)
#### 1. General Information:
* Calcium silicate is a chemical compound with the formula CaSiO3. It is a naturally occurring mineral and can be found in several different forms, including wollastonite, belite, and larnite. It is most commonly found in igneous rocks, but can also be found in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. It has a white or greyish color and a powdery texture.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Calcium silicate is relatively insoluble in water, with a solubility of only 0.08 mg/L at 25°C. However, it is slightly more soluble in acidic solutions, with a solubility of up to 14 mg/L at pH 4. In alkaline solutions, its solubility decreases even further.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Calcium silicate is not considered to be mobile in soil or water. It has a low potential for leaching from soil due to its low solubility and high stability. In water, it can form precipitates at higher temperatures and pH levels, which limits its mobility.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* At high temperatures, calcium silicate can undergo thermal decomposition to form calcium oxide and silicon dioxide. This reaction is reversible and can occur in both high and low temperature environments. At higher temperatures, the solubility of calcium silicate increases slightly, but it is still considered to be relatively insoluble.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Under high pressure, calcium silicate can undergo phase transitions and form different polymorphs. For example, at high pressure and high temperature, it can transform into the mineral stishovite, which has a higher density and different crystal structure than calcium silicate. Under low pressure, calcium silicate can also form other polymorphs such as αquartz and βquartz.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Calcium silicate is relatively pH neutral and is not affected by changes in pH. However, its solubility in water can be influenced by the pH of the solution, with higher solubility in acidic solutions.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Calcium silicate has a melting point of 1540°C and a density of 2.93 g/cm3. It is not flammable and does not react with most chemicals.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Calcium silicate is an essential element for many organisms, including humans. It is an important component in bone and teeth structure and is also necessary for muscle and nerve function.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Calcium silicate has many industrial applications, including as a filler in paper, paints, and plastics, and as an insulation material in hightemperature industrial applications. It is also used in the production of cement and as a component in building materials, such as bricks and tiles. In the food industry, it is used as an anticaking agent in products like salt and sugar.
