# Calcium Nitrite (Ca(NO₂)₂)
#### 1. General Information:
* Calcium Nitrite is a chemical compound with the formula Ca(NO2)2. 
* It is a white crystalline solid, and is composed of one calcium ion bonded to two nitrite ions. 
* It is often used as an additive in concrete or as a corrosion inhibitor for steel.
#### 2. Solubility:
* At room temperature, calcium nitrite has limited solubility in water, with a solubility of approximately 5.86 g/100 mL. 
* This solubility increases with increasing temperature, with a solubility of 68 g/100 mL at 100°C. 
* It is also soluble in ethanol and slightly soluble in ether.
#### 3. Mobility:
* In soil and rocks, calcium nitrite has low mobility due to its low solubility in water. It is not expected to leach into groundwater or contaminate surface water. However, it can be mobilized in soil by acidic conditions, which can result in leaching and potential contamination of water sources.
* In the atmosphere, calcium nitrite can be transported in particulate form or dissolved in rainwater. It can also react with other chemicals in the atmosphere, forming nitrates and/or nitric acid, which can then be transported to other areas.
* In water bodies, calcium nitrite can be transported by water currents. It is not expected to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* The solubility of calcium nitrite increases with increasing temperature. At high temperatures, calcium nitrite can decompose into calcium oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and oxygen, which may result in decreased levels of calcium nitrite in the surrounding environment.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Calcium nitrite is not significantly affected by changes in pressure. It remains stable under normal atmospheric pressure, and does not undergo any significant changes in properties or behavior.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Calcium nitrite is relatively stable in neutral or slightly acidic conditions. However, in highly acidic conditions, it can decompose into nitric oxide and calcium nitrate. In highly alkaline environments, it may also decompose into calcium carbonate, nitrate ions, and water.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Calcium nitrite has a melting point of 256°C and a boiling point of 409°C. It is a strong oxidizing agent and can react vigorously with reducing agents. It is not flammable but may accelerate the burning of other combustible materials.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Calcium nitrite does not have any significant biological or toxicological effects. However, it can cause irritation to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract upon direct contact, inhalation, or ingestion.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Calcium nitrite is primarily used as a corrosion inhibitor in concrete, especially in areas with high chloride concentration. It can also be used as a corrosion inhibitor for steel in other applications, such as in cooling towers, pipelines, and in the production of fertilizers.
* In the construction industry, calcium nitrite is added to concrete mixes to extend the life of concrete structures and prevent corrosion of reinforcing steel. In the production of fertilizers, it is used as a source of nitrogen and as a corrosion inhibitor for metal pipes.
* Overall, calcium nitrites properties, such as its low solubility and pH sensitivity, make it a useful additive in various industrial applications to prevent corrosion and extend the life of materials. However, it should be handled and used with caution due to its strong oxidizing properties.
