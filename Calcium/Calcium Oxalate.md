# Calcium Oxalate
#### 1. General Information:
* Calcium Oxalate is a chemical compound with the molecular formula CaC2O4. It is a colorless, odorless, and crystalline solid. It is naturally found in the form of calcium oxalate monohydrate (whewellite) or dihydrate (weddellite) in plants, rocks, soils, and water bodies. It is also commonly known as calcium oxalate monohydrate or calcium oxalate dihydrate.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Calcium Oxalate is sparingly soluble in water, with a solubility of 0.027 g/L at 25째C. Its solubility increases with the presence of acidic and basic solutions. However, at high pH levels, it forms insoluble precipitates. It is also insoluble in organic solvents like ethanol and acetone.
#### 3. Mobility:
* In terms of mobility, calcium oxalate has a low to moderate mobility in soils. It can move through soil profiles under certain conditions, but its movement is limited due to its low water solubility. It can also be adsorbed onto soil particles, reducing its mobility further.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* At high temperatures, above 200째C, calcium oxalate decomposes into calcium carbonate and carbon dioxide. At low temperatures, below 0째C, it can form icelike crystals, leading to the formation of kidney stones in the human body.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Under high pressure, calcium oxalate can transform into a denser form of its structure. This can occur under deep burial conditions in sedimentary rocks.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Calcium Oxalate is highly pH sensitive. At low pH levels, it is more soluble and can readily dissolve. However, at high pH levels, it forms insoluble precipitates, making it less mobile and available.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Calcium Oxalate has a melting point of 365째C and a density of 2.2 g/cm3. It is nontoxic and nonflammable. It is also a strong reducing agent, making it useful in various industrial applications.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* In plants, calcium oxalate is an important storage form of calcium. It is also involved in the defense mechanism of some plants against herbivores. In animals, it can act as an antinutrient, reducing the absorption of essential minerals. It is also a major component of kidney stones, which can cause health issues.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Calcium Oxalate has various industrial applications, such as in the production of oxalic acid, a commercial bleaching agent. It is also used as a polishing and grinding agent in the manufacturing of pottery, glass, and electronic components. In the food industry, it is used as a preservative and flavoring agent. Additionally, calcium oxalate is used in the production of some pharmaceutical drugs and dietary supplements.
