# Calcium Stearates Ca(C₁₇H₃₅COO)₂)
#### 1. General Information:
* Calcium stearates (chemical formula: Ca(C18H35O2)2) are a type of metallic stearate, which are compounds of a metal ion (e.g. calcium) with stearic acid (a longchain fatty acid). 
* They are typically solid, white powders with a waxy texture and a faint odor. 
* They are nontoxic, nonirritating, and noncorrosive, making them suitable for various industrial applications.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Calcium stearates have low solubility in water, with a solubility of less than 0.001 g/100 mL at 25°C. 
* They are slightly soluble in cold alcohol but more soluble in hot alcohol. 
* They are also soluble in vegetable oils, mineral oils, and organic solvents such as acetone and benzene.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Calcium stearates tend to have low mobility in the environment due to their low solubility in water. 
* In soils and rocks, they can bind to sediment particles and remain in place. 
* In water, they may adsorb to sediments or be transported downstream by water currents.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* At high temperatures (above 150°C), calcium stearates can decompose, releasing stearic acid and calcium oxide. 
* This reaction is reversible, and if the temperature is lowered, calcium stearate can reform. 
* At low temperatures (below 0°C), calcium stearates can form a stable gellike structure, which can affect their solubility and mobility.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Under high pressures, calcium stearates can become compacted and dense, decreasing their solubility and mobility. 
* However, at low pressures, they can form micelle structures, increasing their solubility and mobility.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Calcium stearates are sensitive to changes in pH. At low pH levels (below 5), they can react with acids and form salts. At high pH levels (above 9), they can react with bases and form soaps. These reactions can affect the solubility and mobility of calcium stearates.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Calcium stearates have a melting point of around 150°C and a boiling point of around 360°C. They have a low density (0.99 g/cm3) and a low vapor pressure. They are insoluble in acids and alkalis and have a high compatibility with other materials, making them useful as lubricants and release agents.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Calcium stearates are nontoxic and are considered safe for use in food and pharmaceutical products. 
* They are also biodegradable, which means they can break down into natural products over time. 
* However, in high concentrations, they may be harmful to aquatic life and can affect soil microbial activity.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Calcium stearates have a wide range of industrial applications. 
* These include use as lubricants, anticaking agents, release agents, emulsifiers, and stabilizers in various industries such as plastics, rubber, cosmetics, and food. 
* They are also used in the production of paper, textiles, and detergents. In the agricultural industry, calcium stearates are used as additives to improve the flow and dispersibility of pesticides and fertilizers.
