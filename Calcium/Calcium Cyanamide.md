# Calcium Cyanamide
#### 1. General Information:
* Calcium Cyanamide, also known as nitrolime or lime nitrogen, is a chemical compound with the molecular formula CaCN2. It is a white to grayishblack crystalline solid that is highly soluble in water and decomposes in acid. It is produced by treating calcium carbide with nitrogen gas at high temperatures.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Calcium Cyanamide is highly soluble in water, with a solubility of 375 g/100 mL at 20°C. This makes it highly mobile in soil and water, as discussed in the next section.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Due to its high solubility in water, calcium cyanamide is highly mobile in both soil and water. It can easily move with the flow of water in the soil and can also be transported by water bodies such as rivers and streams. In soil, it can leach through the soil layers, especially in sandy soils with high permeability. This can lead to potential contamination of groundwater and surface water.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* Calcium cyanamide has a relatively high melting point of 1300°C and is stable at temperatures up to 800°C. However, at higher temperatures, it decomposes to form calcium oxide, nitrogen gas, and small amounts of hydrogen cyanide. This decomposition is highly exothermic and can result in fire or explosion if not handled properly.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* At standard pressure, calcium cyanamide is stable. However, at high pressures, it can decompose into calcium nitride and nitrogen gas. The exact pressure at which this decomposition occurs is not well documented.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Calcium cyanamide is alkaline in nature, with a pH of around 811 in water. It can increase the soil pH when applied, leading to potential nutrient availability issues for some crops. However, this alkalinity can also have positive effects on soil microbial activity and improve soil structure.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Calcium cyanamide is relatively dense, with a specific gravity of 2.9. It is not flammable but can act as a fuel in the presence of strong oxidizing agents. It has a low vapor pressure and is not volatile.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* Calcium cyanamide is toxic to both humans and animals. Ingestion or inhalation of calcium cyanamide can lead to respiratory issues, liver and kidney damage, and even death. It can also have negative effects on plant growth and is mostly used as a herbicide to control weeds.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Calcium cyanamide is mainly used as a fertilizer due to its high nitrogen content (around 20%). It provides a slowrelease of nitrogen, making it suitable for crops with long growing seasons. It is also used as a starting material for the production of other chemicals, including calcium cyanide, cyanuric acid, and melamine. In some countries, it is also used as a soil fumigant to control pests and diseases.
