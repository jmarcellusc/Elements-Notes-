# Calcium Dihydrogen Phosphate (Ca(H₂PO₄)₂) Properties

Here's a comprehensive overview of calcium dihydrogen phosphate (Ca(H₂PO₄)₂), detailing its solubility, mobility, and properties under various temperature and pressure conditions, as well as its behavior in the atmosphere, soil, rock, and water.

## 1. General Information
- **Molecular Formula**: Ca(H₂PO₄)₂
- **Molar Mass**: 174.09 g/mol
- **Appearance**: White crystalline solid or powder
- **Common Forms**: Often exists as a dihydrate (Ca(H₂PO₄)₂·H₂O).

## 2. Solubility
- **In Water**: Calcium dihydrogen phosphate is highly soluble in water, with solubility approximately 1.6 g/L at 25°C. This high solubility is due to the presence of hydrogen ions in its structure, which facilitate dissolution.
- **In Acids**: It dissolves readily in dilute acids, producing calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H₂PO₄⁻).
- **In Bases**: The solubility decreases in alkaline conditions, leading to potential precipitation of calcium phosphate salts.

## 3. Mobility
- **Soil Mobility**:
  - **High Mobility**: In soils, calcium dihydrogen phosphate exhibits high mobility due to its solubility. It can easily dissolve and be transported with soil moisture.
  - **In Acidic Soils**: Its mobility increases in acidic soils, where it can dissolve further, enhancing nutrient availability for plants.
- **Rock Mobility**: Calcium dihydrogen phosphate is generally less stable in rock formations. Its presence in rocks is limited, but it can be released through weathering, particularly in acidic conditions that promote dissolution.
- **Atmospheric Mobility**: Calcium dihydrogen phosphate does not exist in a gaseous state, so it has negligible mobility in the atmosphere. However, as dust particles, it can be transported short distances from soil or industrial activities.
- **Water Mobility**: Due to its high solubility, calcium dihydrogen phosphate is mobile in aqueous environments. It can readily dissolve in water, releasing calcium and phosphate ions, making it available for biological uptake.

## 4. Temperature Effects
- **Low Temperature**: At low temperatures, calcium dihydrogen phosphate remains soluble, and its solubility does not significantly decrease. It can form stable aqueous solutions.
- **High Temperature**: The solubility of calcium dihydrogen phosphate increases slightly with temperature. However, at temperatures above 100°C, the dihydrate form can lose water, transitioning to an anhydrous form (Ca(H₂PO₄)₂) or further decomposing to calcium metaphosphate.

## 5. Pressure Effects
- **Normal Pressure**: Under normal atmospheric pressure, calcium dihydrogen phosphate remains stable and retains its properties.
- **High Pressure**: At extremely high pressures, such as those found in deep geological formations, it may undergo structural changes. However, this typically does not occur in natural environments.

## 6. pH Sensitivity
- **In Acidic Conditions**: Calcium dihydrogen phosphate is soluble, increasing the availability of calcium and phosphate ions for plants and microorganisms.
- **In Alkaline Conditions**: Its solubility decreases significantly, and it can precipitate as calcium phosphate, reducing nutrient availability.

## 7. Other Physical Properties
- **Density**: ~2.3 g/cm³ (for the dihydrate)
- **Melting Point**: Decomposes before melting, typically above 1000°C.
- **Lattice Structure**: Monoclinic crystal system.

## 8. Biological Significance
Calcium dihydrogen phosphate plays an important role in biological systems as a source of calcium and phosphate, both essential for plant growth and development. It is also a component of animal feed.

## 9. Industrial and Practical Applications
- **Fertilizers**: Commonly used as a source of phosphorus in fertilizers due to its high solubility.
- **Food Industry**: Used as a calcium supplement and acidity regulator in food products.
- **Dental and Medical Applications**: Utilized in certain dental cements and as a supplement in bone regeneration materials.
