## Calcium Sulfate Anhydrite (CaSO₄)

Calcium Sulfate (CaSO₄), commonly found in its hydrated forms like gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) and anhydrite (CaSO₄ without water), is a naturally occurring mineral widely used in construction, agriculture, and other industries. It's also known for its role in the formation of sulfate-rich soils and in controlling water hardness. Below is a detailed analysis of the solubility, mobility, and other properties of Calcium Sulfate (CaSO₄), with attention to its behavior under various temperature and pressure regimes.

### 1. General Properties of Calcium Sulfate Anhydrite (CaSO₄)

* **Chemical Formula:** CaSO₄
* **Molar Mass:** 136.14 g/mol
* **Forms:**
    * Anhydrite: CaSO₄ (without water)
    * Gypsum: CaSO₄·2H₂O (dihydrate form)
    * Hemihydrate: CaSO₄·½H₂O (also known as plaster of Paris)
* **Appearance:** White or colorless crystalline solid, commonly found as gypsum in nature.
* **Odor:** Odorless.
* **Density:**
    * Gypsum: 2.32 g/cm³
    * Anhydrite: 2.98 g/cm³
* **Hardness:** Gypsum has a Mohs hardness of 2, making it soft and easily scratched.
* **Melting Point:**
    * Gypsum: Decomposes at ~150°C (loss of water).
    * Anhydrite: Decomposes around 1,450°C.
* **Boiling Point:** Does not boil, decomposes instead.

### 2. Solubility of Calcium Sulfate Anhydrite (CaSO₄)

* **In Water:**
    * Calcium sulfate is sparingly soluble in water:
        * Solubility of anhydrite (CaSO₄) in water is around 2.0 g/L at 25°C.
        * Solubility of gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) is slightly higher, at 2.4 g/L at 25°C.
    * Temperature Dependence: The solubility of calcium sulfate decreases slightly with increasing temperature, which is unusual for most salts.
    * At higher temperatures (above 50°C), the solubility reduces due to the common ion effect and the formation of less soluble anhydrite.
* **In Acids:**
    * Calcium sulfate is more soluble in strong acids, such as sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), where it forms soluble calcium salts. However, it is generally less reactive compared to calcium carbonate.
* **In Organic Solvents:**
    * Insoluble in most organic solvents like alcohol or acetone.

### 3. Mobility of Calcium Sulfate Anhydrite (CaSO₄)

* **In Water:**
    * Calcium sulfate has moderate mobility in natural water systems due to its low solubility. It can dissolve and move in groundwater, rivers, or lakes, but only up to its saturation limit.
    * In areas with high evaporation rates, such as deserts or drylands, calcium sulfate can accumulate at the surface or near groundwater, leading to the formation of sulfate-rich soils.
    * In soil and aquatic environments, calcium sulfate can leach through soil layers but remains relatively immobile once the water becomes saturated.
* **In Soil:**
    * Calcium sulfate is often applied to agricultural soils as a soil amendment (gypsum) to improve structure, drainage, and reduce soil compaction.
    * Due to its low solubility, calcium sulfate remains relatively stable in soils and does not leach quickly compared to more soluble compounds like nitrates or bicarbonates.
* **In Air:**
    * Calcium sulfate does not become airborne under normal conditions. However, in powdered form (as plaster of Paris or gypsum dust), it can be released into the air during construction, handling, or mining activities.

### 4. Behavior Under Temperature and Pressure

* **At High Temperatures:**
    * **Gypsum Dehydration:** At around 100-150°C, gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) loses its water of hydration, transforming into hemihydrate (CaSO₄·½H₂O, also known as plaster of Paris):

    ```
    CaSO₄·2H₂O → CaSO₄·½H₂O + 1.5H₂O
    ```

    * **Anhydrite Formation:** Upon further heating above 150°C, hemihydrate further dehydrates to form anhydrite (CaSO₄).
    * **Thermal Decomposition:** Anhydrite decomposes at around 1,450°C, breaking down into calcium oxide (CaO) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which occurs in industrial processes such as cement manufacturing.
* **At Low Temperatures:**
    * At low temperatures, calcium sulfate remains stable in its hydrated forms (gypsum) or as anhydrite, with no significant changes in solubility or chemical behavior.
* **Pressure Effects:**
    * Under high pressure, calcium sulfate does not undergo significant chemical changes, but pressure and temperature can influence the transition between its different hydrated forms. Anhydrite is more stable than gypsum at higher pressures and temperatures, making it the predominant form in deep geological environments.

### 5. Chemical Properties

* **Reaction with Water:**
    * Calcium sulfate dissolves in water to release calcium (Ca²⁺) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻) ions. Its dissolution is governed by the low solubility product constant (Ksp):

    ```
    CaSO₄ ↔ Ca²⁺ + SO₄²⁻
    ```

* **Neutral pH:** Calcium sulfate is a neutral salt in water and does not significantly alter the pH of the solution, unlike calcium hydroxide (which is strongly basic) or calcium carbonate (which is mildly basic).
* **Reactivity with Acids:**
    * Calcium sulfate does not react vigorously with acids but will dissolve in strong acids, forming soluble calcium salts and releasing sulfuric acid ions.
* **Reactivity with Bases:**
    * Calcium sulfate is generally stable in the presence of bases, with little reactivity. However, in concentrated basic solutions, it may form calcium hydroxide and sulfate ions.

### 6. Industrial and Environmental Applications

* **Construction:**
    * **Plaster of Paris:** Made from calcium sulfate hemihydrate, which rehydrates when mixed with water to form gypsum. It's widely used in building materials, molds, and casts.
    * **Cement Production:** Anhydrite is used as a retarder in cement, slowing the setting process to allow for proper shaping.
* **Soil Amendment:**
    * **Gypsum:** Gypsum is used to improve soil structure by reducing compaction and enhancing water infiltration in agricultural soils. It's especially useful in clay-heavy soils and helps to mitigate the effects of saline soils by providing calcium ions to displace sodium ions.
* **Water Treatment:**
    * **Calcium Sulfate:** Calcium sulfate is used in water treatment to control hardness, particularly in water softening processes.

### 7. Safety Considerations

* **Ingestion:** Calcium sulfate is non-toxic and is used in food as a firming agent (e.g., in tofu).
* **Inhalation:** Prolonged exposure to gypsum dust or anhydrite powder can cause respiratory irritation. Proper ventilation and protective gear should be used in environments with high dust exposure.
* **Contact with Skin/Eyes:** Non-corrosive, though fine powders may cause mechanical irritation upon prolonged contact.

Calcium sulfate (CaSO₄) in its various forms, including gypsum and anhydrite, is characterized by low solubility and moderate mobility in water. It is used in construction, agriculture, and water treatment. Gypsum undergoes thermal dehydration to form plaster of Paris, and at higher temperatures, it decomposes to calcium oxide and sulfur dioxide. Its stable neutral pH and low reactivity with acids and bases make it valuable for controlling soil structure, improving water infiltration, and reducing soil salinity.

## 9.  Mineralogical Properties
Anhydrite converts to gypsum when exposed to water, which creates a volume increase that destroys any planar features in the beds. The reverse is also possible—anhydrite can be created when gypsum is dehydrated.

Both minerals display vitreous luster and are white in color and streak. The calcium in either mineral may be substituted by small amounts of strontium and barium. But gypsum and anhydrite have differing physical characteristics that can help to identify them. Gypsum is soft and can be scratched with a fingernail. It has four different cleavage surfaces, and its crystals display a variety of forms, the most common being a granular, massive rock known as alabaster. Another type, selenite, is a transparent crystalline material that forms large, well-developed crystals. Aggregates of fibrous gypsum form a variety called satin spar.

Although associated with gypsum, anhydrite lacks H2O molecules. Anhydrite closely resembles gypsum in hand samples, but it has three cleavage planes at 90 degree angles. In addition, anhydrite is slightly harder and denser compared with gypsum and may have a bluish tint. Both gypsum and anhydrite are used as soil additives and in portland cement. Because of its use in drywall manufacturing, gypsum is more economically desirable.
