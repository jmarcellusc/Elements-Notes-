# Calcium Thiocyanate
#### 1. General Information:
* Calcium Thiocyanate, also known as calcium sulfocyanide, is a chemical compound with the molecular formula Ca(SCN)2. It is a colorless crystalline solid and is highly soluble in water. It is commonly used as a laboratory reagent and can be found in various industries as a source of thiocyanate ions.
#### 2. Solubility:
* Calcium Thiocyanate is highly soluble in water, with a solubility of approximately 62.4 g/100ml at room temperature (25°C). Its solubility increases with increasing temperature, making it more soluble in hot water than in cold water. It is also slightly soluble in alcohol and acetone.
* In soil, the solubility of calcium thiocyanate can vary depending on the type of soil and its characteristics. Generally, it has low solubility in most soils and tends to bind with soil particles, making it less available for leaching.
#### 3. Mobility:
* Calcium Thiocyanate has low mobility in soil, meaning it does not move easily through the soil. This is due to its tendency to bind with soil particles and its low solubility in water. Therefore, it is not expected to leach into groundwater.
* In the atmosphere, calcium thiocyanate can be transported by wind and can contribute to the formation of acid rain. In water, it can be transported by currents and can also adsorb onto suspended particles.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
* The solubility of calcium thiocyanate increases with increasing temperature. This means that at higher temperatures, it is more likely to dissolve in water and become more mobile. In terms of its effect on temperature, calcium thiocyanate does not have any specific properties or reactions.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
* Calcium Thiocyanate is not significantly affected by pressure changes. At high pressures, it may become more soluble in water, but there are no major changes in its properties.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
* Calcium Thiocyanate is relatively pH insensitive, as its solubility does not change much with changes in pH. It is stable in acidic, neutral, and alkaline environments.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
* Calcium Thiocyanate has a melting point of 149°C, and it decomposes at higher temperatures. It also has a density of 1.79 g/cm3 and is considered to be a nonvolatile compound at room temperature.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
* In the environment, calcium thiocyanate does not occur naturally and is mainly produced by human activities. In high concentrations, it can be toxic to aquatic organisms due to its ability to interfere with the metabolism of thyroid hormones. However, in low concentrations, it has no significant biological effects.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
* Calcium Thiocyanate is commonly used in the production of thiocyanates, which are used as initiators in polymerization reactions. It is also used as a reagent in organic synthesis and as a source of thiocyanate ions in analytical chemistry. In the food industry, it is used as a preservative for fruits and vegetables.
