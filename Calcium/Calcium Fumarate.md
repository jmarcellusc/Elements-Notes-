# Calcium Fumarate
#### 1. General information:
*  Calcium fumarate is a chemical compound with the formula Ca(C4H2O4)2.
*  It is a white, odorless solid with a molecular weight of 210.2 g/mol.
*  This compound is commonly used as a food additive and can be found in various calciumfortified products such as breakfast cereals, energy bars, and supplements.
*  It is also used as a nutritional supplement for its high calcium content.
*  Calcium fumarate is relatively stable and does not react with acids, alkalis, or oxidizing agents.
#### 2. Solubility:
*  Calcium fumarate is slightly soluble in water, with a solubility of approximately 0.49 g/L at 20°C.
*  Its solubility increases with increasing temperature, but even at 100°C, it only reaches a solubility of about 1.17 g/L.
*  In acidic solutions, calcium fumarate is more soluble due to the formation of calcium ions.
*  It is also more soluble in polar solvents such as ethanol and methanol.
#### 3. Mobility:
*  In soil, calcium fumarate is immobile and does not migrate to deeper layers.
*  It can, however, be dissolved and transported in soil water due to its solubility.
*  Due to its low water solubility, it is not expected to leach into groundwater.
*  In the atmosphere, calcium fumarate is not mobile and will not undergo significant chemical reactions or transformations.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
*  Calcium fumarate is stable at high temperatures and does not decompose.
*  However, its solubility increases with increasing temperature, as mentioned earlier.
*  In low temperatures, it may form hydrates, but these are not stable and will decompose upon heating.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
*  At normal atmospheric pressure, calcium fumarate is a solid.
*  Under high pressure, it may become slightly more soluble in water due to increased hydration of the compound.
*  However, at extreme pressures, it is possible for calcium fumarate to decompose into calcium carbonate and fumaric acid.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
*  Calcium fumarate is relatively stable over a wide pH range and is not affected by changes in pH.
*  However, in acidic conditions, it may form calcium ions and become more soluble, as mentioned earlier.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
*  Calcium fumarate has a low melting point of 240°C.
*  It has a low vapor pressure and is not expected to volatilize into the atmosphere.
*  This compound is not affected by light exposure.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
*  Calcium fumarate is a good source of calcium and has been used as a nutritional supplement to prevent or treat calcium deficiency.
*  It is also used in the food industry as a food additive and as a source of calcium fortification in various food products.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
*  Calcium fumarate is used in the production of food supplements, pharmaceuticals, and food fortification.
*  It is also used in the production of calcium supplements and calciumfortified products.
*  In the agricultural industry, it is used as a soil amendment to correct calcium deficiencies in soil and improve plant growth.
