# Calcium Formate
#### 1. General Information:
*  Calcium Formate is a calcium salt of formic acid with a chemical formula of Ca(HCOO)2.
*  It is a white crystalline solid with a strong odor of formic acid.
*  It is commonly used as a working and setting accelerator, in the manufacturing of cement, plasterboard, and other construction materials.
*  It is also used as a corrosion inhibitor, and as a preservative in animal feed.
*  Calcium formate has a molecular weight of 130.12 g/mol and a density of 2.02 g/cm³.
#### 2. Solubility:
*  Calcium formate is highly soluble in water, with a solubility of 116g/L at 20°C.
*  It is also soluble in other polar solvents like alcohols and acetone.
*  In general, the solubility of calcium formate decreases as the temperature increases.
#### 3. Mobility:
*  In soil, calcium formate is highly mobile due to its high solubility in water.
*  It can be easily transported through the soil profile, especially in sandy or loamy soils.
*  In rock, calcium formate is not mobile as it tends to precipitate in the solid phase.
*  In the atmosphere, calcium formate can be transported through air currents but will eventually settle due to its high density.
*  In water, calcium formate is highly mobile and can be transported over long distances.
#### 4. Temperature Effects:
*  Calcium formate is stable at high temperatures, with a melting point of 300°C.
*  At low temperatures, it can form hydrates, which may lead to a decrease in solubility.
*  The solubility of calcium formate increases as temperature decreases.
*  At very high temperatures, calcium formate can decompose to form calcium oxide and carbon monoxide.
#### 5. Pressure Effects:
*  The solubility of calcium formate is not significantly affected by changes in pressure.
*  However, at high pressures, the potential for calcium formate to precipitate out of solution may increase.
#### 6. pH Sensitivity:
*  Calcium formate is slightly acidic, with a pH of about 6.57.0 in aqueous solutions.
*  In basic environments, it may undergo hydrolysis to form calcium hydroxide and formic acid.
#### 7. Other Physical Properties:
*  Calcium formate is a hygroscopic material, meaning it can absorb and retain moisture from the surrounding environment.
*  It has a low vapor pressure and is not expected to volatilize into the atmosphere.
*  The density of calcium formate decreases as the temperature increases, which can affect its mobility and distribution in different environmental media.
#### 8. Biological Significance:
*  Calcium formate is generally considered nontoxic to humans and animals.
*  It is used as a food additive and is also incorporated into some animal feed formulations.
*  In the environment, it is not expected to bioaccumulate in organisms or have significant effects on ecological systems.
#### 9. Industrial Applications:
*  Calcium formate is commonly used in the construction industry as a setting accelerator for cement and other building materials.
*  It is also used as a corrosion inhibitor in the oil and gas industry.
*  In agriculture, it is added to animal feed as a preservative and to improve palatability.
*  It can also be used as a reducing agent in organic synthesis reactions.
